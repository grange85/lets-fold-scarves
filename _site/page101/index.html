                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Maidenform"</strong> (Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1755" title="Mad Men - Maidenform - Don leaves Bobbie tied up" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/mad-men-maidenform.jpg" alt="Mad Men - Maidenform - Don leaves Bobbie tied up" width="426" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I watch <em>Mad Men</em> and wonder what the hell the characters are doing and why.</p>
<p>This should have been a brilliant episode but it seemed to miss the mark for me too many times.</p>
<p>Four examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>I simply don't believe that an unaccompanied woman would be allowed in a strip club in the early sixties.</li>
<li>Would Betty really wander around serving breakfast to her children in a bikini? (No matter how hot a month of May it was.)</li>
<li>This may be a trivial example but while it was shocking that a person could dump his dog outside to fend for itself while he goes off to drink (or commit suicide or not to drink, I dunno) it lost its sadness when the dog turned away and, after spotting his off-screen handler, trotted off tail wagging.</li>
<li>The use of a modern song at the beginning was jarring and <em>wrong</em>. After 18 episodes of perfectly chosen music this was extra-specially wrong even if the lyrics were appropriate.</li><br />
</ol><br />
The irony of excluding the people who actually wear Playtex (and probably buy most of it) was sad. I thought Peggy was excessively passive throughout which made her transformation seem even sillier. Just who is she going to listen to next?</p>
<p>Poor Pete. He has absolutely no idea what an arse he is. He tries so hard to chat amiably with Peggy but is rebuffed. He makes friends with a girl dog who's a boy dog. He then shags a model (who failed to get the part) in the living room of her apartment with her mother next door. His self awareness is pitiful. He actually thinks he isn't a loser.</p>
<p>Fucking Don - take that in all its meanings - he is such a horrible character at the moment. I'm glad he took a moment to think at the end. He needs to get a grip and soon. He has all he needs at home if he would just look.</p>
<p>I'm itching for Betty to tell Don where to shove his patronising hypocritical attitude. I suspect I have a long wait.</p>
<p>I guess we have seen the last of Bobbie unless her next appearance is to take some sort of well deserved revenge on Don. I don't like the character at all but Melinda McGraw plays her brilliantly.</p>
<p>The Jackie/Marilyn/Madonna/whore thing was interesting and I have no doubt the assvertising industry would love to have two such strong models to divide modern women into such day and night categories. I see Peggy as a Joanne Woodward.</p>
<p>I'm not the brightest of people so I didn't get that Don was a bit of a Jackie/Marilyn/Madonna/whore himself and missed the symbolism of the mirror at the end but I really don't understand how people could query his discomfort at being celebrated as a hero on Memorial Day.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The New Girl"</strong> (Robin Veith)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" title="Mad Men - The New Girl - Peggy and Bobbie" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/mad-men-25.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The New Girl - Peggy and Bobbie" width="426" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Bobbie was bearable which I attribute to the character being portrayed as less sexual predator and more rounded person</li>
<li>Melinda McGraw who plays Bobbie has a resemblance to noughties Madonna</li>
<li>I was confused by the timeline because I assumed that Bobbie was just staying with Peggy for the day and not until her black eye diminished</li>
<li>Peggy's flashbacks were welcome particularly since they ultimately led to my favourite moment of S2 so far when Peggy called Don "Don"</li>
<li>Betty's "because we love him" answer to Sally's question about Don's salt intake was really poignant</li>
<li>Pete is just about a <strong>complete</strong> ass: hee-hawing about his viable sperm and just completely forgetting about his wife's feelings</li>
<li>he redeemed himself by not storming out but stopping himself to actually listen to Trudy</li>
<li>I'm not sure what to make of Don's new secretary but I do miss sweet, kind useless Lois</li>
<li>I was most pleased to see Rachel because it closes a door in Don's life</li>
<li>I do wish her husband was as good-looking as Don because I don't want to think of her as settling for second best via pop culture's shorthand that ordinary looking people are mundane individuals (hello, Susan Boyle)</li><br />

                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "A Spy in the House of Love" </strong>(Andrew Chambliss)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1741" title="dollhouse-19-echo "I'm not broken"" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dollhouse-19-echo.jpg" alt="dollhouse-19-echo "I'm not broken"" width="494" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p>What a great episode. Why were the first five so crap? Or why were episodes 1, 3 and 4 so crap? Even three more mundane episodes to the standard of 2 and 5 might not have made this series so hard to get into. I am glad I persevered but it was a close thing; I was pretty unforgiving at the direness of <em>Dollhouse</em>&rsquo;s first offerings. I don&rsquo;t think the excuse of a new team taking time to bed-in is an adequate excuse. Maybe the really bad ones are the equivalent of&nbsp;&ldquo;Teacher&rsquo;s Pet&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Robot, You Jane&rdquo;: basically rubbish but redeemed in retrospect by fans scrambling around for funny dialogue and briefly meaningful moments.</p>
<p>I literally spent periods watching this with my mouth open and I said to Andy that I needed an advert break except the way we are watching it means we don&rsquo;t get any (though I do know <em>Prison Break</em> is back).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1740" title="dollhouse-19-ivy-and-laurence" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dollhouse-19-ivy-and-laurence.jpg" alt="dollhouse-19-ivy-and-laurence" width="462" height="300" /></p>
<p>The moral confusion in this show is surely at its height. All the non-dolls are now morally compromised now that Paul has to be immoral if he wants to bring the Dollhouse down.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised to see charts and some string in Paul&rsquo;s apartment wall because that implies he has found out stuff on his own.</p>
<p>Random awesome bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mellie closing down and telling Paul all. I just loved how Miracle Laurie switched off and on.</li>
<li>&ldquo;My name is Bond, Victor Bond&rdquo; I said before the suave Englishman got into his Porsche. And Adelle is different from Hearn how?</li>
<li>Dominic&rsquo;s brain wipe (aka trip to the attic): oo, the irony of him being mean to Echo&hellip;</li>
<li>The ironic irony conversation and Olivia Williams&rsquo; spellbinding performance. In the future when I rewatch Dollhouse (and I think I will) I believe that Williams will be my prime interest along with the casting find of Enver Gjokaj who, fingers crossed, is a major star at the beginning of his career.</li><br />
</ul><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739" title="dollhouse-19-roger-and-catherine" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dollhouse-19-roger-and-catherine.jpg" alt="dollhouse-19-roger-and-catherine" width="472" height="300" /></p>
<p>The acting continues to impress me and only Fran Kranz has failed to win me over and I don&rsquo;t think it is because of Topher&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>I liked how this episode was structured. It reminded me of &ldquo;Out of Gas&rdquo; and that is a big compliment. I haven&rsquo;t thought too hard about the various plotlines because I&rsquo;m sure they don&rsquo;t all bear up to scrutiny and I&rsquo;m not in the mood for being mean. Hooray. Like <em>Firefly</em>, to me, this series is less about its &ldquo;lead&rdquo; but more about the other individuals in the ensemble. Kudos to Eliza Dushku for not insisting that the show be <em>all</em> about her character(s).</p>
<p>It even managed to ape <em>Alias</em> in perhaps the weakness part of the episode. I would rather see Jennifer Garner running in heels than Dichen Lachman.</p>
<p>Echo&rsquo;s self awareness took a huge leap forward and if I was feeling as grumpy as before I&rsquo;d be taking that story development to task for its suddenness and inconsistency. Did last week&rsquo;s reset have no effect on Echo at all?</p>
<p>To finish, a criticism: I understand that the conversation at the beginning between Echo and Boyd was important because Echo was talking about trust but since I was both fascinated and repelled by her outfit I have no recollection of anything she said. Maybe, in the future, important conversations could be conducted by people wearing cardigans.</p>

                  <p><strong>Two to Go</strong> (Douglas Petrie)/<strong>Grave</strong> (David Fury)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728" title="two-to-go-willow-hand" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/two-to-go-willow-hand.jpg" alt="two-to-go-willow-hand" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to commit heresy. Alyson Hannigan isn&rsquo;t very good as Dark Willow. The terrible dialogue that she was saddled with didn&rsquo;t help her. &ldquo;Get off, superbitch&rdquo; (a throwback to &ldquo;This Year&rsquo;s Girl&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Cause I&rsquo;ve turned pro&rdquo; are just two of the clunkers littering the script.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729" title="Two to Go - Willow tries to look scary" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/two-to-go-willow.jpg" alt="Two to Go - Willow tries to look scary" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I have no idea whether it was AH&rsquo;s choice or the directors&rsquo; or the showrunners&rsquo; to have her so one-note as <em>if</em> she is controlling a great rage but unfortunately she appears as if she is suppressing <em>nothing</em>. It&rsquo;s as if there is zilch going on under the surface: it&rsquo;s all shallow water (a puddle even) and highly disappointing. We get a glimpse of the Hannigan magic, and what she can do, when she collapses into tears and into Xander&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731" title="Grave - willow in xander's arms" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/grave-willow-and-xander.jpg" alt="Grave - willow in xander's arms" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Villains&rdquo; now seems a fantastic episode compared with these two. The opportunity for an exploration of Willow&rsquo;s character was generally passed up for laughable sequences such as Willow tearing down the police station (and screaming) and riding on top of the cab of a truck. The scene between Buffy and Willow at Rack&rsquo;s is the notable exception except that Willow is more perceptive about Buffy than she is about herself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1725" title="Two To Go - Dawn shuffles into shot with Willow and Buffy" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/two-to-go-buffy-dawn-willow.jpg" alt="Two To Go - Dawn shuffles into shot with Willow and Buffy" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>Willow murders Rack (though interestingly what she does to him which kills him doesn&rsquo;t kill Giles when she does it to him) and nobody cares. Unless I missed the note informing us that Rack isn&rsquo;t human, she kills a man and <em>nobody</em> cares.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730" title="Two to Go - Willow murders Rack" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/two-to-go-rack-and-willow.jpg" alt="Two to Go - Willow murders Rack" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>Talking of not caring, I really really don&rsquo;t care about Spike and his challenges to get - - - a soul - - - and not what Buffy has coming to her. A gigantic yawn of a mislead which kept getting in the way of the main story.</p>
<p>[Discussion question: did Spike ruin <em>Buffy</em>?]</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732" title="Grave - tacky spire (er temple)" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/grave-tacky.jpg" alt="Grave - tacky spire (er temple)" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>The special effects in <em>Buffy</em> are generally cheesy but that&rsquo;s no problem for someone raised on <em>Blake&rsquo;s 7</em>. However, the spire (aka temple) at the random bluff we have never heard of before was tacky and off-putting. Well, not completely off-putting so that the scene between Willow and Xander isn&rsquo;t beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>It was good of Willow to take time off from ending the misery of all of us to give Buffy something to do in the finale.</p>
<p>One of my other disappointments with <em>Buffy</em> is the complete failure to do something interesting with Dawn. No wonder folk don&rsquo;t like her when she is written so implausibly and immaturely. The promise we see as she fights the demons alongside Buffy was sadly not capitalised on.</p>

<p>I liked Anya and Xander&rsquo;s conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>I care if you live or die, Xander. I'm just not sure which one I want.</p>
<p>Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at, uh, Wiccapalooza. And if it gets really bad...</p>
<p>Let me guess. You'll propose?</blockquote><br />
The fight between Willow and Buffy was no Faith/Buffy face-off, which was unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1726" title="Two to Go - Giles - I'd like to test that theory" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/two-to-go-giles.jpg" alt="Two to Go - Giles - I'd like to test that theory" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>Giles&rsquo; appearance at the end of &ldquo;Two to Go&rdquo; was the bestest thing eva. However, as Andy put it, the laughter from Giles when he hears the summation of S6 from Buffy is a bit rich because <em>we</em> had to sit through it and it wasn&rsquo;t actually funny.</p>
<p>Andy reckons S6 isn&rsquo;t so bad and thinks my sad fannishness (not that he called it that) is the reason why I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;m not so sure that he is right because there is so much fabulous Tara stuff in S6 and I still don&rsquo;t like it as a whole. I have no desire to watch episodes like &ldquo;Smashed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wrecked&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gone&rdquo;, &ldquo;Doublemeat Palace&rdquo; and &ldquo;As You Were&rdquo; ever again and I think that is the worst thing I can say about <em>Buffy</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try very hard while watching S7 (alongside <em>Angel</em> S4) to be positive. I will be banning the words &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; because ultimately this a TV show created by Joss Whedon and, honestly, despite what I also say about <em>Dollhouse</em>, I do care.</p>
