                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Needs" </strong>(Tracy Bellomo)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1709" title="Dollhouse Needs - Echo Sierra November Victor" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/needs-the-four-of-them.jpg" alt="Dollhouse Needs - Echo Sierra November Victor" width="511" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p>This failed to engage me; it felt flat and unconvincing.</p>
<p>Echo&rsquo;s closure was the only one that worked for me except I now can&rsquo;t see that my theory that there is more to her than a freer of lab rats can have any weight any more.</p>
<p>I have gigantic reservations about Sierra&rsquo;s storyline (let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; who can&rsquo;t not have reservations?) and I can&rsquo;t see what closure she got. She meets the man who put her in the Dollhouse (and he&rsquo;s even worse than you can imagine (I&rsquo;d rather have the billionaire from &ldquo;Man on the Street&rdquo; with his shades of grey than this character&rsquo;s (Billy from <em>Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion</em>) utter blackness)) and she stands there letting Victor do the work (not that I&rsquo;m suggesting hitting him is adequate) and it's only after she has shared a kiss with Victor that she falls asleep. So, what does that mean for her? The only thing I can thing of is that she has now stopped linking her rape by Hearn to Victor. Shit, Joss, what are you doing to Sierra?</p>
<p>If anyone in the Dollhouse knows how Sierra got into the Dollhouse then the moral ambiguity in the show now equals zero. Actually, Boyd&rsquo;s words seem to indicate that he <em>does</em> know and he can still work there? I&rsquo;m not happy.</p>
<p>Enver Gjokaj and Dichen Lachman continue to impress me with the strength of their performances and they have chemistry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711" title="Dollhouse - Needs Sierra Victor" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/needs-sierra-and-victor.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Needs Sierra Victor" width="534" height="270" /></p></p>
<p>Miracle Laurie was asked to be even drippier than Mellie Mk I, and ye gods, what did they put her in? She looked like a Dust Bowl Okie. What would have been wrong with jeans and a t-shirt like the others? She is also very tall although I should have realised that knowing that she wasn&rsquo;t dwarfed by Tahmoh.</p>
<p>November&rsquo;s closure was a mystery to me. Presumably, before the Dollhouse she knew her daughter was dead so how does visiting her grave help at all? Yep, she&rsquo;s still dead. Funny gravestone too with no surname and no dates.</p>
<p>Erm, Victor&rsquo;s closure was sweet, he gets a kiss and can now relax.</p>
<p>Paul was once again practically redundant. It looks like this white knight might save the day by being passive: people keep sending messages to him after all. I called the dream sequence as soon as he opened the door to Echo. This is a Joss Whedon show after all. It was a bit tacky and shows that Paul is definitely a screw up. We need some background motivation for him real soon.</p>
<p>I hope that female handler got a bonus for being beaten up by Echo because somebody forgot to tell her it was an exercise.</p>
<p><em>Dollhouse</em> makes no sense in many ways. It&rsquo;s frustrating and the goodwill it regained after &ldquo;True Believer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Man on the Street&rdquo; is being eroded. The dolls have been reset so unless there is a twist involving Dr Saunders&rsquo; actions then episode 9 starts it all over again. Great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1710" title="Dollhouse Needs Dr Saunders" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/needs-dr-saunders.jpg" alt="Dollhouse Needs Dr Saunders" width="431" height="300" /></p>
<p>I read yesterday via Whedonesque that <em>Dollhouse</em> may actually be renewed. The last five episodes have to trend towards fabulous or, I&rsquo;m afraid, I will stop watching. Gulp.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Three Sundays"</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1697" title="Pete in his shorts in Mad Men Three Sundays" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/vincentkartheiser_204sundays121.jpg" alt="Pete in his shorts in Mad Men Three Sundays" width="563" height="300" /></p>
<p>I think it would be awesome if the twist in <em>Mad Men</em> is that by the end of S2 Don and Betty are a proper couple who talk to each other about things that bother them and consequently come to an understanding of themselves and how their relationship could work successfully and happily. Or else she&rsquo;ll have an affair and leave him.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times I haven&rsquo;t been sympathetic to Betty&rsquo;s attitudes and I was quite cross with her. A simple &ldquo;Bobby, would you put that robot in the other room and come back and eat your dinner.&rdquo; would have saved a lot of shoving but then we wouldn&rsquo;t have had the great ending.</p>
<p>I was fed up with Don asking Betty what she wants him to tell her but that little opening up of his <em>self</em> to her and her quiet snuggling up to him was tremendous.</p>
<p>It took a great effort to remind myself that Betty&rsquo;s passing of the disciplining buck to Don was totally of the time of &ldquo;just wait until your father gets home&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the mother should demand the father punish the children because she is supposed to defer to him too. That&rsquo;s patriarchy.</p>
<p>Although Don isn&rsquo;t immune from resorting to violence, I am so pleased that he is refusing to continue the cycle of abuse with his son. Great stuff.</p>
<p>I could have done without revolting Bobbi turning up again and I&rsquo;ll be pleased if I never see her and her sleazy ways again. Which brings me to Roger who I detest and whom I don&rsquo;t care about at all.</p>
<p>Father Gill resembled Pete and I liked his relationship with Peggy. I liked that he was a true Christian and didn&rsquo;t judge her harshly. Her sister&rsquo;s actions make sense since she&rsquo;s an unhappy housewife and it doesn&rsquo;t look like Peggy is remorseful. It was extremely mean of her, mind you.</p>
<p>The American Airlines story was dull except, and this is a major except, we got to see Pete in his tennis shorts. I really do love Pete and Vincent Kartheiser is wonderful. I even said to Andy that I wanted to watch <em>Angel</em> again. We left Angel at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Christina Hendricks really does have huge boobs. I have no idea how Sally could possibly compare Betty&rsquo;s to Joan&rsquo;s.</p>

                  <p><strong>Villains</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>The ending of this is vile. Truly Willow is Dark. Cold blooded murder. Nasty.</p>
<p>Coolest scene: Willow absorbing the dark magic and going dark. A chilling and memorable moment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1684" title="villians-willow" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-willow.jpg" alt="villians-willow" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>Poor Dawn. The only emotional part of this episode is her sitting in the dark, shocked &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687" title="villians-dawn" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-dawn.jpg" alt="villians-dawn" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also put Xander and Buffy&rsquo;s muted reaction to the news of Tara&rsquo;s death down to shock. At least Buffy looks concerned and I&rsquo;m sure there is plenty of time to pay proper tribute to her. OK, I&rsquo;ll stop snarking and think positively.</p>
<p>The conversation between Buffy, Xander and Dawn is heavy handed but otherwise this episode is good. Willow&rsquo;s reaction is in character. Vampire Willow was a sadistic, cruel piece of work.</p>
<p>Why can't Dawn go with Buffy? It is so bloody boring that she has got to kept safe all the bleeding time. And her sister's the Slayer: teach her self defence, Buffy. And, this really bugs me. I know that Buffy is depressed and that's one of the reasons she works in a burger bar but why couldn't she have become a fitness instructor or someone who works in a gym?</p>
<p>Spike in &ldquo;Africa&rdquo; was tedious and I hate being mislead by his use of &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s okay for Warren to use it because I think he might be a misogynist. Not sure though, it&rsquo;s kinda subtle.</p>
<p>My word, Adam Busch is a hairy chap. I hope Amber got paid the full amount for this episode even though she did spend a lot of time lying on the floor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s dead and only two to go except they renege on that promise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686" title="villians-warren" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-warren.jpg" alt="villians-warren" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been to watch S6 in real time and for it to wind up over three episodes and three weeks. It&rsquo;s too long.</p>
<p>Buffy's hair was very nice.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Echoes"</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1670" title="dollhouse-echoes-topher-adelle" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-17-topher-adelle.jpg" alt="dollhouse-echoes-topher-adelle" width="484" height="300" /></p>
<p>Maybe it is too early for an effective &ldquo;Band Candy&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Tabula Rasa&rdquo; type episode but since the chances of a third or sixth season of Dollhouse are less than zero, I will take one now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take anything that makes me adore Olivia Williams who was hilarious. She really made her role in this episode work.</p>
<p>I appreciated that Topher was only marginally different on drugs than his usual annoying, unbearable self. He managed to be unpleasant as he pulled at November&rsquo;s head and shook it from side to side. He is not a likable young man.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1671" title="dollhouse-echoes-topher-mellie-adelle" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-17-topher-mellie-adelle.jpg" alt="dollhouse-echoes-topher-mellie-adelle" width="475" height="300" /></p>
<p>I was initially disappointed that Caroline&rsquo;s story was that she was an animal rights activist which didn&rsquo;t strike me as all interesting. However, on reflection I feel that her being set up as a bit of a clich&eacute; student activist is going to be developed much further. Adelle does talk of two years playing &ldquo;this dance&rdquo; which suggests to me that their conversation isn&rsquo;t straight after the break in.</p>
<p>Since the reactions to the drugs depended on whether the characters were normal or actives then a few characters have been ruled out as actives. The notable exception is Dr Saunders.</p>
<p>The main storyline put me in mind of superhero cartoon. I fully expected Batman to turn up. It was plainly ridiculous (a drug that acts through touch and wears off before the episode ends!) but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realise that Alice was dressed as a Japanese schoolgirl. The client Matt is a creep and one of the stipulations of hiring a doll should include &ldquo;no video recording&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Paul had even less to do than episodes 1-5 except to react to being dumped by his girlfriend. Their relationship has been soured for this viewer so perhaps it&rsquo;s a good thing. It won&rsquo;t be a good thing if it&rsquo;s goodbye to Miracle Laurie which it might be since she isn&rsquo;t a featured cast member. Boo.</p>
<p>The supporting cast was sterling as usual notably Reed Diamond as an apologetic Lawrence and Enver Gjokaj&rsquo;s smart NSA agent.</p>
<p>This was by no means as good as last week&rsquo;s (or least the second half of last week&rsquo;s) but was better than 1-5. However, losing its must-see momentum was an error. Not surprisingly, I won&rsquo;t be sad if Dollhouse isn&rsquo;t renewed because it isn&rsquo;t very good and I think Joss Whedon should be doing something (anything) else and with a better actress as his lead. Eliza is still okay but that might be okay if the series didn&rsquo;t need an amazing, fantastic, awesome, convincing, marvellous actress and not an okay one.</p>
<p>After last week&rsquo;s topless Paul we had topless Sam so it&rsquo;s a positive relief that there is equal opportunity ogling allowed. Sierra&rsquo;s white lab coat, short skirt and high heels get up was ridiculous. Who do we criticise? Mutant Enemy costumers or Topher and the unseen back room staff of the Dollhouse?</p>
