<p><strong>End of Days</strong> (Douglas Petrie &amp; Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>The writers do a terrible job regarding the Scythe because it is the most awful plot contrivance. Why does Caleb tell Buffy (via Shannon in &ldquo;Dirty Girls&rdquo;) that he has something of hers. Her interest wasn&rsquo;t even interest until this lumpen villain was shoehorned into the show. Hey! can you tell I&rsquo;m not a fan? The Scythe really should have introduced a long time ago along with the Guardians.</p>
<p>Now there may be tons of things unresolved in <em>Buffy</em> notably the fiasco of &ldquo;Empty Places&rdquo; but at least we know what happened to Miss Kitty Fantastico. I find it hard to get over the fact that the Scoobies behave as if nothing happened between them. I can understand that the writers are running out of time (series wise) but that makes the decision to do something awful like chuck Buffy out of her home even less wise: they really didn&rsquo;t need to do that traitorous thing.</p>
<p>Poor Eliza, she&rsquo;s always unconscious in Buffy.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;End of Days&rdquo; has a place in my heart, it is because it has one of my favourite moments of Buffy:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href=" http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-whatyourname.wav">I'm sorry. What's your name?<br />
Buffy<br />
No, really?</a></blockquote><br />
I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of Angel&rsquo;s appearance except to say that if I had to choose a Buffy boyfriend, I&rsquo;d go for him. But what was the point of Spike also being there except to annoy everybody; people who ship and people who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This episode is incredibly dull in parts which is a real shame - <em>Buffy</em> limped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed a Potential called Caridad if she hadn&rsquo;t been played by Dania Ramirez who had the thankless role of Maya in <em>Heroes</em>. Sorry to jump ahead but it seems odd to have her so prominent in &ldquo;Dirty Girls&rdquo;, this, and &ldquo;End of Days&rdquo; only for her to not be in &ldquo;Chosen&rdquo;. [Sign of the times that I am wittering on about the actor who played Maya, for heaven's sake.]</p>
<p>By the time this episode got to &ldquo;Sweetie, you're pushing too hard&rdquo;, I was feeling a little steamed,  what with the hand-held camera and the over-lapping dialogue. What is <em>Buffy</em> coming to when Kennedy has more lines than Willow?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think so. I just need to get together a few ingredients.&rdquo; Oh, boring. Sorry. How Willow fell from being my favourite character to this irritating shell makes me really sad. She was actually fun in LA so what were they doing with her in <em>Buffy</em>?</p>
<p>Why does Spike punch Faith? And why does he accuse her of getting what she wanted? She once wanted to have what Buffy had in terms of love and family but I sure don&rsquo;t think she ever wanted responsibility. Faith often seems misrepresented which means somebody is wrong so when I re-watch <em>Buffy</em> I shall pay more attention to her story (which is taken up very well in <em>Angel</em>).</p>
<p>Why does Giles just slash the Bringer&rsquo;s throat and pronounce that they had enough information? I reckon Giles is much more to blame for the disaster that follows than Faith is.</p>
<p>I think the writers do quite a subtle job on Spike because essentially he&rsquo;s pretty dense. He thinks he has Faith sussed but Buffy knows the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always nice to see Harry Groener as the well-mannered Mayor.</p>

                  <p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2488" title="Mad Men - The Color Blue - Betty and Don" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/Mad-Men-s03-e10-Betty.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The Color Blue - Betty and Don" width="550" height="292" /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Color Blue"</strong> (Kater Gordon* and Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p>I was surprised with all the love that this episode got online. It was good but it felt very much part of the build up to the conclusion of S3. Only <em>Mad Men</em> could have someone make a huge discovery and then make us and them wait to do something about it.</p>
<p>Many people find the domestic scenes dull and want more Sterling Cooper machinations. Since Betty is the most intriguing character for me then I am happy for the show to spend time with her. I am less happy to spend time with Don and Suzanne. I think her brother is more important. Don saw Adam in that boy and tried to help him which he failed to do for Adam. I think the money and card are going to prove important but I don't know how. Many people think Suzanne is nuts which I find eye-rollingly irritating (just as people were so utterly determined that Don was Jewish in S1). I thought her following Don onto the train was unbelievable (she should be doing her job, for heaven's sake) rather than sinister. Her morals are lacking, that's true. And she make that phone call.</p>
<p>I liked the short scenes leading up to Betty's finding of the keys but I do wish they had shown Betty going through the box more thoroughly. I think the focus on the divorce papers was distracting but I do wonder if she is going to California soon. My favourite moment in the show was when Betty sat down in the chair and her face was caught by a patch of sunlight: she was illuminated. The gut wrenching moment in the show was Don telling Betty that he wanted to show her off at the dinner: ouch, that sums up what he thinks of you, Betty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2489" title="Man Men - The Color Blue - Paul and Peggy" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/mad-men-s03-s10-Paul.jpg" alt="Man Men - The Color Blue - Paul and Peggy" width="550" height="232" /></p>
<p>Peggy was awesome throughout. She was funny, kind, thoughtful and brilliant. Paul's face was full of astonished admiration rather than anything sinister when she pulled that idea out of the bag.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a cheek to want a writer to tell a different story from the one that he or she is determined to tell. However, I can't disagree with the point of view of Donny Brook <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2009/10/18/the-episode-in-which-everything-happens/#comment-60063">over at Basket of Kisses</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are so many intriguing ideas and characters they&rsquo;ve just left lying around while we obsess on Don&rsquo;s same old boring behavior. I mean what was the point of PPL &ndash; how can the Brits just leave before the Beatles arrive in the states? How can MW have wasted such a delicious character as Moneypenny? How come Ken still doesn&rsquo;t have a backstory? Was Peggy&rsquo;s dalliance with Duck just a one night stand? Is the Ken/Pete war just a red herring? Are they ever going to flesh out Carla and Hollis, or at least introduce one AA character that is like a real human being? I know, let&rsquo;s make Pete rape someone and then don&rsquo;t have him on for 3 episodes! Let&rsquo;s write out Sal and push Joan out to the side, nobody cares about them!</blockquote><br />
*now off the show: I thought this and "The Fog" were fine work</p>

<p><strong>Empty Places</strong> (Drew Z. Greenberg)</p>
<p>Everyone is leaving Sunnydale. Buffy has a cold. Willow uses the force. Willow cries. Caleb is boring. Faith goes dancing. Buffy reiterates how freaking marvellous Spike is. The First has a cold. Amanda gets drunk. Spike and Andrew have chemistry as they talk about onion blossoms with Andrew&rsquo;s arms wrapped around Spike&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>The empty places in this episode are in the writers&rsquo; heads. I don&rsquo;t actually mind the notion of a revolt against Buffy&rsquo;s cold leadership but this is so forced and stupid; Buffy&rsquo;s closest friends betray her and her own sister kicks her out of her own house (and without a toothbrush and a change of clothes).</p>
<blockquote><p>But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier than us.</blockquote><br />
What a load of tripe. That&rsquo;s right, seven years of not earning and not working, that&rsquo;s our Buffy.</p>
<p>Aargh, if I hadn&rsquo;t already reached the rough part of my <em>Buffy</em> relationship then I would probably loathe this as much as &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Party&rdquo; and &ldquo;Into the Woods&rdquo; but...</p>
<p>Three to go!</p>

<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Wee Small Hours"</strong> (Dahvi Waller and Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p>In a series full of great scenes, the scene when Don fires Sal is up there with Betty shooting pigeons and Peggy telling Pete that she had his baby. Don may be damaged and a wee bit stressed about living a whopping great big lie but he isn&rsquo;t actually very nice (which damaged people can be). I understand why he fired Sal (sort of) but <em>how</em> he did it was cruel and appalling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shake his hand!&rdquo; I shouted several times at Sal. I am devastated for Sal but I think the scene in the phone box in the park with a leather boy in the background was a wee bit too much.</p>
<p>As was Pete&rsquo;s coughing fit. However, most people would have left the room.</p>
<p>Harry is sweet but useless. I reckon Sal would been sacked anyway but by doing nothing, Harry ensured that was the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reject him!&rdquo; I shouted at Suzanne. Not that I care about her at all. I can honestly say the only thing I can remember her saying in all her appearances is that she was going to talk about Martin Luther King to her pupils. She doesn&rsquo;t engage me at all. Is it the actor? Poor characterisation? (And what is it with the jogging in the middle of the night and the staying up late drinking? She must get about two hours sleep.) All I care is that with her so close to home, Don is bound to get caught.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s Midas touch as an ad man is deserting him. Awful people like Connie Hilton (nobody likes your hotels, well, okay, my mum wasn&rsquo;t impressed anyway) and his lunatic demands aren&rsquo;t helping Don (not much sleep going on in the Draper house) but I loved Don&rsquo;s humiliation when Connie told him how disappointed he was in him.</p>
<p>I could not stand being in a job that demanded my attention outside normal hours, which, of course, explains why I have been in the same department for nearly 21 years.</p>
<p>I thought the writing for Betty during the fund raising scene was dreadful. I can see Betty being put out that Henry didn&rsquo;t turn up but she would not have been so rude to the woman and certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have stomped across the room like a twelve year old. No well bred person who cared as much for appearances would behave like that not even fan favourite (/sarcasm) Betty Draper.</p>
<p>I did like her coming to her senses in Henry&rsquo;s office. I think the turn of the key in the lock was the trigger for her; the moment she realised that an affair may only be a fling for him (maybe not) but whatever she definitely wants more than that.</p>
<p>Betty was seen being nice to her children and to Carla. It really did happen folks; there is no need to be so blind about her character.</p>
<p><em>Mad Men</em> is the best thing on TV. I look forward to it each week but each week I feel a little bit deflated; a little bit as if it isn&rsquo;t quite as good as it could have been. For example, I do think we don&rsquo;t know enough about the internal business of Betty, and this makes her seem, to many people, to be fickle and shallow. I&rsquo;m not sure that she is but in the first season, I used to get irritated when people thought her childish because I never thought she was. However, in TV series time, it is three and a half years later and she now does behave childishly at times. She hasn&rsquo;t changed enough and it is, dare I say, a little tedious.</p>
<p>As an aside last night, I said to Andy that Don was the Spike of <em>Mad Men</em>. By that I meant, I don&rsquo;t, in my heart, give a toss about his past or about his interactions with anybody (notable exceptions are Betty and Peggy) but unlike Spike in <em>Buffy</em>, Don is the lead character. There was no way I could ever enjoy &ldquo;The Jet Set&rdquo; because it was all about him. And I desperately don&rsquo;t care about his affairs, which is sort of a huge chunk of what <em>Mad Men</em> is about.</p>
