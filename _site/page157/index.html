                  <p><strong>The Prom</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img id="image379" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/buffy-and-angel-4-ever.jpg" alt="Buffy and Angel 4 ever" /></div><br />
Sentimental or moving? Well, only one episode of <em>BtVS</em> made me cry and it wasn&rsquo;t this or <em>Seeing Red</em>.</p>
<p>Anya: &ldquo;You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millennium of treachery and oppression from the males of the species and I have nothing but contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why you talking to me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't have a date for the prom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What exactly is Wesley doing wandering around Sunnydale High? And, why would he be chaperoning a high school dance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Buffy&rsquo;s world, we just live in it&rdquo; I do appreciate that sentiment but I care much more about Willow and her relationships and Xander and his than I do about Buffy&rsquo;s. Maybe it&rsquo;s the drawn out masochistic nature of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Right there, zoom in on that.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's a videotape.&rdquo; &ldquo;So? They do it on television all the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not with a regular VCR they don't.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a bit much making fun of this aspect of tv when <em>BtVS</em>&rsquo;s computer skills leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Xander buying Cordelia&rsquo;s dress is a really nice touch. I will be happy to know differently but does he ever mention her again?</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s lonely fight with the hellhounds with almost no witnesses seems to be a sad moment but the students of SHS are not quite as blind as we thought.</p>

                  <p><strong>Choices</strong> (David Fury)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image376" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/faith-and-a-knife.jpg" alt="Faith is given a knife" /></div>The big question: is Willow worth &ldquo;thousands of lives&rdquo;?</p>
<p>With Willow getting accepted to Oxford ("tea-bag central), MIT, Yale, Harvard, Mars University, etc, I think they rather overdid the Willow is bright thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that Willow used a 9H pencil to dust the vampire because it would have needed to be extra hard to do what it did. Plus it is difficult to believe that someone as terrified and as new to witchcraft would have that sort of control. Remember what happens to her control at the beginning of Doppelgangland?</p>
<p>Her standing up to Faith is more likely: &ldquo;Oh yeah? Give me the speech again, please. "Faith, we're still your friends. We can help you. It's not too late."&rdquo; &ldquo;It's way too late. You know, it didn't have to be this way. But you made your choice. I know you had a tough life. I know that some people think you had a lot of bad breaks. Well, boo hoo! Poor you. You know, you had a lot more in your life than some people.  I mean, you had friends in your life like Buffy. Now you have no one. You were a Slayer and now you're nothing. You're just a big selfish, worthless waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor may be a bad guy but he&rsquo;s on the nose about Angel and Buffy&rsquo;s future: &ldquo;Yeah, and that's just one of the things you're going to have to deal with. You're immortal, he's not. It's not. I married my Edna May in ought-three and I was with her right until the end. Not a pretty picture. Wrinkled and senile and cursing me for my youth.  Wasn't our happiest time. And let's not forget the fact that any moment of true happiness will turn you evil. I mean, come on. What kind of a life can you offer her? I don't see a lot of Sunday picnics in the offing. I see skulking in the shadows, hiding from the sun. She's a blossoming young girl and you want to keep her from the life she should have until it has passed her by. My God!  I think that's a little selfish. Is that what you came back from Hell for? Is that your greater purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can also feel sorry for Snyder: &ldquo;You. All of you. Why couldn't you be dealing drugs like normal people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, this isn't about you. Although I'm fond, don't get me wrong, of you. The other night, you know, being captured and all, facing off with Faith. Things just, kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fighting evil here for three years, and I've helped some, and now we're supposed to decide what we want to do with our lives. And I just realized that that's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worth doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in.&rdquo; This does make sense and I do hope that she eventually graduated with honours (or the US equivalent).

                  <p>In the outer world of the Internet there are two major discussions concerning the depiction of women in comics and getting women to read comics. These two topics are often not mutually exclusive because I guess there aren't a huge amount of women who read <em>Nuts</em> and other offensive non-top shelf magazines for the same reasons they don't read comics with covers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AmazonGlory.JPG">this</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't read and have no intention of reading comics which are likely to offend me as a woman (life is far far too short). However, I do like comics so I have been lurking and absorbing suggestions for comics that women might like (I shan't get into discussing the notion that women en mass like <em>anything</em> because if that was true I would think Jamie Cullum was awfully cute). But on that note, here are some comics I have read recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong> (Terry Moore) I am up to #86 and this soapy ride of high drama, weepy moments and hilarity is remarkably good. It has been inconsistent but never dull.</li>
<li><strong>Ex Machina Vol 1: The First Hundred Days</strong> (Brian K. Vaughan) I raced through this and I am thoroughly impressed at the marriage of politics and super-hero but there is one sentence that made me ewww and I hope its like won't be repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Global Frequency: Planet Ablaze</strong> (Warren Ellis) The art greatly influenced whether I liked the issue or not with the Norwegian and London ones being stand outs due to the work by Jon J. Muth (<strong>Big Sky</strong>) and David Lloyd (<strong>The Run</strong>). I hated the bionic man one (<strong>Big Wheel</strong>) because Fabry's art is ugly.</li>
<li> <strong>Serenity: Those Left Behind</strong> (Joss Whedon and Brett Matthews) What a crock. I don't think I can emphasise just how disappointing this was in its utter feebleness. The art was inconsistent, the story weak and the dialogue so-so. It did nothing I hoped it would which in particular would have been to find out more about the enigmatic Shepherd Book.</li>
<li><strong>Astonishing X-Men #1-12</strong> (Joss Whedon) <strong>Gifted</strong> was fine and I eagerly anticipated <strong>Dangerous</strong> which was BtVS season 7 awful and I wanted to cry because it was so lame.</li>
<li><strong>Neverwhere #1&ndash;4</strong> (Mike Carey) This is based on Neil Gaiman's work set in an underground London. The settings didn't convince and I really dislike Glenn Fabry's art so I won't be seeking out the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Summer of Love</strong> (Debbie Drechsler) A simply drawn graphic novel of small town life which was absorbing but like most coming of age dramas it didn't have a satisfactory ending which is like life I suppose but slightly deflating to read.</li>
<li><strong>V for Vendetta</strong> (Alan Moore) Fantastic stuff: lots to think about, strong characters and a superb ending. Plus dolls and the letter V all over the place.</li>
<li><strong>Runaways vol. 1 #1-18, Runaways vol. 2 #1-12 and Runaways vol. 2 #13-18</strong> (Brian K. Vaughan) The first 12 issues are totally awesome with the cleverest conclusion I seen or read in a long time. Volume 2 was always going to pale in comparison and I thought the release of Karolina from her earthly bonds was weak (and the art wasn't by Alphona!).<br />
</ul></p>

                  <p>Type <strong>pop culture heroines</strong> into Google and it asks you if you meant <strong>pop culture heroes</strong>. Which is obviously why a blog called <a href="http://www.popcultureheroines.com/">Pop Culture Heroines</a> is needed.</p>
<p>It uses the lovely <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=10-849">Joshua Middleton</a> cover of River from the Serenity comic books in its banner.

                  <p><strong>Earshot</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>A cracking episode with much to love except, nitpicking here, the misdirection with Jonathan using a hunting rifle to attempt suicide.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;It was intense.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, for a minute there I thought you're gonna make an expression&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I felt one coming on. I won't lie.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Strange for me to say this but the scene between Buffy and Angel was excellent. She really does need to ask rather than obsess because it isn&rsquo;t healthy.</p>
<p>The scene when Buffy reads the thoughts of all the Scoobies is fantastic: Willow&rsquo;s dismay at Buffy knowing more about her taciturn boyfriend than she does, Xander&rsquo;s one track mind and Cordelia&rsquo;s literal one is all very funny:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;I am my thoughts. If they exist in her, Buffy contains everything that is me and she becomes me. I cease to exist.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hmm...&rdquo; &ldquo;What am I gonna do? I think about sex all the time! Sex! Help! 4 times 5 is thirty. 5 times 6 is 32. Naked girls. Naked Women! Naked Buffy! Oh stop me!&rdquo; &ldquo;God Xander! Is that all you think about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Actually...bye.&rdquo; &ldquo;Look at Cordelia. No! Don't look at Cordelia! She's a student! Oh I am a bad man. I'm a bad, bad man!&rdquo; Excuse me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What's it like Buffy?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't know. It's a little weird. But...look, please, don't for a second think that I don't need you, because I do. I want to share this with you. It's like all these doors are opening to all these little worlds, and I can just walk right inside.&rdquo; &ldquo;No one else exists either. Buffy is all of us. We think. Therefore, she is.&rdquo; &ldquo;She knows so much. She knows what Oz is thinking. I never know that. Before long, she'll know him better than I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, don't think that.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can't help it Buffy. I'm sorry, I just can't.&rdquo;</em></blockquote></p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;You had sex with Giles?! You had sex with Giles?!&rdquo; &ldquo;It was the candy! We were teenagers!&rdquo; &ldquo;On the hood of a police car?!?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'll be downstairs. You feel better.&rdquo; &ldquo;Twice!!!!&rdquo;</em></blockquote><br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Willow interrogates Jonathan <em>again</em> and the other investigations are also fun: I do like is sort of cutting from location to location while keeping the narrative thread (see also <em>Checkpoint</em>, <em>Bushwhacked</em> and <em>De-clawed</em>).</p>
<p>Hard to believe but when you&rsquo;re not a beautiful one but true:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;You know what? I was wrong. You are an idiot. My life happens to, on occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than I can handle. And it's not just mine. Every single person down there is ignoring your pain because they're too busy with their own. The beautiful ones. The popular ones. The guys that pick on you. Everyone.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you could hear what they were feeling. The loneliness. The confusion. It looks quiet down there. It's not. It's deafening.&rdquo;</em></blockquote></p>
<p>This is the perfect coda, Buffy had learned and grown as a person but even she&rsquo;s not that gorgeous a person:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;Well, it's nice to be able to help someone in a non-slaying capacity. Except, he's starting to get that look, you know, like he's gonna ask me to Prom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, it would probably be good for his self-esteem, if you...&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh come on! What am I, Saint Buffy? He's like three feet tall!&rdquo;</em></blockquote></p>
