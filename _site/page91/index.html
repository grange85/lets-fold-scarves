<p><strong>The Killer in Me</strong> (Drew Z. Greenberg)</p>
<p>This is the Buffy has a cold episode. It has three separate story-lines of varying degrees of interest. The Spike story is as engaging as any Spike story this season although the funniest joke came about because of this line: "Who you gonna call?" Both Andy and I said "Ghostbusters" and then Spike spoke again "God, that phrase is never gonna be useable again, is it?" (very funny Drew).</p>
<p>Giles had a wonderful exchange with Buffy at the beginning and I reckon her description of the vision quest was pretty accurate although she appears to have omitted mention of the gourd.</p>
<p>I am obviously a keen and close watcher (ho ho) because I was blissfully unaware first time viewing that Giles was behaving out of character and that many many people thought he might be the First. Oh well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2319" title="The Killer in Me - Giles" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/The-Killer-in-Me-Giles.jpg" alt="The Killer in Me - Giles" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>Giles being pounced on by "a teenager, a powerful former demon, and two big geeks" was very funny and although Giles's line: "you think I'm evil...if I bring a group of girls on a camping trip and don't touch them?" was ooc, it was still the second funniest joke in the episode.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to the Willow story-line is that it was well acted and nicely dramatic.</p>
<p>I don't understand why Joss &amp; co thought that Willow should get over Tara and find a new partner over the course of S7. If you remove my bias towards Tara, it still doesn't make sense. The death of Tara resulted in Willow doing unspeakable things (that's obviously a turn of phrase because Willow blabs it all over the place as if it wasn't that important (<a href="http://www.triviaguide.net/category/angel-episodes/as4/415a/">including in LA</a>)). But, anyway, why <em>should</em> she get over it and move on?</p>
<p>I actually find Iyari Limon quite appealing as Kennedy. She's okay. She's no Seth Green or Amber Benson but she is okay.</p>
<p>What isn't okay is her behaviour. From the very beginning she has behaved in an inappropriate and pushy manner. From the moment she sees Willow she is flirting with her. And in this episode she fakes illness and asks intrusive questions. I totally understand the dislike of her character because of these reasons but, don't blame her, blame the writers. However, I do draw the line at Kennedy being Prince Charming and kissing Willow's misery away.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2320" align="aligncenter" width="534" caption="Kennedy likes to get into everybody&#39;s personal space."]<img class="size-full wp-image-2320" title="The Killer in Me - Kennedy" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/The-Killer-in-Me-Kennedy.jpg" alt="Kennedy likes to get into everybody's personal space." width="534" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Amy's involvement doesn't make sense and her motivation even less so. Amy is jealous of Willow's ability? How could she know? Amy was a rat for most of the time that Willow developed as a witch. True, she had ensouled Angel but floating a pencil was hard work and we only saw her doing that after Amy was ratted. I would totally have believed any explanation from Amy that involved her being upset at being a rat for <em>three</em> years.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2323" title="The Killer in Me - Adam Busch plays Willow" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/3927027484_e543a2a1bc_o.jpg" alt="The Killer in Me - Adam Busch plays Willow" width="533" height="300" /></p>
<p>So the best thing about this episode is that Tara and Willow's feelings about her were directly referenced.</p>
<p>Writing all this down makes me realise that on a superficial level this episode dealt with a lot of issues in an easy to swallow way. However, digestion is bloody hard.</p>

                  <p>Don&rsquo;t ask why but I recently watched an edition of <em>The One Show</em> (broadcast on 22nd July 2009) with Hugh Dennis as the studio guest.</p>
<p>The presenters asked him about the lack of women on such shows as <em>Mock the Week</em> (Dennis is one of the team captains) and he responds that although there are &ldquo;lots of very, very, very funny women but I guess they don&rsquo;t tend to be, you know, <a href="https://cruellablog.blogspot.com/2009/08/but-really-though-are-women-funny.html">stand ups</a>&rdquo; which is why they aren't on the show. Anyway. They moved on to a clip from the special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outnumbered"><em>Outnumbered</em> </a>produced for Comic Relief (13th March 2009) to illustrate that women aren&rsquo;t funny. Dennis (as the dad) does an impression of Eric Morecambe catching an imaginary pebble in a bag and the children laugh heartily. Claire Skinner (as the mum) also does an impersonation of Eric Morecambe by poking her head around the door and being dragged out of sight by her own hand. The children don&rsquo;t laugh and when she asks why not, the boy says that &ldquo;&hellip;mums aren&rsquo;t good at being funny&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG9MDxbdvkM">This </a>is a link to the first part of the whole thing and apparently mums are good at tidying, nagging and saying no.</p>
<p>Back in <em>The One Show</em> studio, Dennis says that in reality &ldquo;it worked the other way round completely. I did that thing and neither of them laughed. And Claire did her thing and they both laughed&rdquo;. I think he then says &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s cheating&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fabulous stuff from Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin that doesn&rsquo;t at all reinforce stereotypes. And thanks to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/theoneshow/"><em>The One Show</em></a> for digging out a clip to illustrate something that isn't true. And look <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/consumer/2009/09/07/what_sex_is_your_brain.html">here</a>!</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Arrangements"</strong> (Andrew Colville &amp; Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2302" title="Mad Men S03E04 - Sally at the door" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Mad-Men-S03E04.jpg" alt="Mad Men S03E04 - Sally at the door" width="500" height="244" /></em></strong></p>
<p>This was a mixed bag of an episode because there was so much I disliked.</p>
<p>Betty and Don are the most dreadful parents. All Don had to do was open his arms and say &ldquo;come here, sweetpea, we are all upset and we are showing it in different ways&rdquo;. Instead the be-tutu&rsquo;d Sally went to lie in the living room watching gloomy stuff on TV and deeply resenting her parents.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that so many people (at Basket of Kisses and TWoP) don&rsquo;t realise (or accept) that Don is as bad as Betty as a parent. They detect warmth in him that is absent from her. However, the only warmth emanating from him is the warmth that ten hours absence a day brings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that Gene was a better grandfather than he was a father although maybe his attempts at bonding weren&rsquo;t that admirable (though they were lots of fun). Grandparents have more time to spend with their grandchildren because (usually) they are no longer working.</p>
<p>The sooner Betty has the baby the better. I am increasingly frustrated at how she is behaving. Hormones, self-centredness, fearfulness and the fact I can&rsquo;t see that her character has changed at all since the end of S2 makes Betty very unattractive at the moment.</p>
<p>There was lots of Peggy to enjoy like her willingness to take Joan&rsquo;s advice (that woman has so much potential) and her silent eloquence regarding the Patio Ann-Margret commercial but I hated that she wrote a great ad for someone else and is now flat-hunting with a totally unsuitable person. I hated this because it is stupid and unworthy of this show. It is rare for such a misfire to occur. I can usually swallow anything Matthew Weiner throws at me.</p>
<p>The jai alai storyline was moderately amusing mainly because it was nice to hear Pete being called Humps.</p>
<p>Sal&rsquo;s pyjamas show that only Pete can pull off the endearing dorky look. Bloody hell though that scene was awesome. Both Bryan Batt and, particularly, Sarah Drew as Kitty were fabulous. I can&rsquo;t be sure just what Kitty has realised but there was definitely a light bulb glowing above her head.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "My Old Kentucky Home"</strong> (Dahvi Waller &amp; Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2295" title="Mad Men s03 e03 - Pete and trudy" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Mad-Men-s03-e03-Pete-and-trudy.jpg" alt="Mad Men s03 e03 - Pete and trudy" width="500" height="236" /></p>
<p>I adored Pete and Trudy dancing and not just because I love VK so much. It was exhilarating and so much fun to watch. Everyone at Roger and Jane's do should have enjoy that display. Whee.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" title="mad men s03 e03 - peggy smoking" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/mad-men-s03-e03-peggy.jpg" alt="mad men s03 e03 - peggy smoking" width="467" height="332" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peggy Olson. I wanna smoke some marijuana.&rdquo; Hee. I liked Peggy's secretary although she has been introduced a little abruptly and didn't seem particularly believable but through her interactions with Peggy we got a lot of Peggy goodness: "Don't worry about me. I am going to get to do everything you want for me. I am going to be fine, Olive, I really am."</p>
<p>Elisabeth Moss is playing Peggy to perfection and she is propelling her character to the top of my list now that Betty has become so boring. I was really invested in her in S2 but after 3 episodes of this season it really does feel like nothing has happened (an accusation often used against <em>Mad Men</em>) and I am losing interest.</p>
<p>Additionally, I find the whole Draper household generally depressing. Sally and her grandfather give me the creeps, her thieving is unpleasant, and Don is, well, Don. His comment to Roger about looking foolish was interesting since Don may behave foolishly (often) but never looks it. (Unlike in <em>30 Rock</em> where the Hamm was splendid. He really is a good actor and even manages to look older as Don...)</p>
<p>I was wondering how Roger could afford a fancy country club event (what with the divorce and his daughter's wedding) but Andy reminded me that he had pocketed 1/2 million at the end of S2. Do you think Don has told Betty that they too are rich?</p>
<p>Other highlights include Joan shutting up her nasty husband ("Then you should stop talking.") and Christina Hendricks playing the accordion. And Alison Brie is really sweet as Trudy. Paul is insufferable. I like Smitty.</p>

<p>This follow up to "Showtime" was also pretty poor with more tedious speeches by Buffy. Maybe it's SMG's choice but her arm crossing to connote stern seriousness is becoming parodic.</p>
<p>Andrew's dialogue is getting repetitive with a variation of his "now I'm good" speech from "Bring on the Night" turning up here.</p>
<p>The First is in "remission"? And the town is still "lousy with Bringers"? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Andy noted that Molly's English accent is now becoming a highlight of each episode which is sadly true.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2009/08/23/sorry-to-barge-in-we-have-a-slight-apocalypse/comment-page-1/#comment-894"><strong>Georgia</strong></a>'s comment that the potentials are "like a powerful new addition to the mythology" is a fair one if that is what I wanted to see in the show. However, I want the Scoobies not the newbies. And not one of them looks fifteen.</p>

<p>Dawn was in danger of getting an interesting storyline. Although I don't think I would have wanted her to be a potential slayer, she desperately needed a stronger purpose on the show. Even in the comics she still isn't that interesting.</p>

<p>Since Xander is my least favourite Scooby: he bugs me a lot of the time particularly when he gets all judgey towards the others. However, his speech about being not being special but extraordinary is rather lovely.</p>
<p>I don't really understand why Willow is <em>frequently</em> not allowed to do magic without <em>great</em> consequences occurring&nbsp; (i.e. black eyes) <em>whereas</em> if it suits the plot she <em>is</em> allowed to do locator spells.</p>
