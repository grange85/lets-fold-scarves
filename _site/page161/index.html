                  <p><strong>Gingerbread</strong> (story by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820692/">Thania St. John</a> and Jane Espenson, written by Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>This had the feel of a season one episode and really isn&rsquo;t very good apart from the scene between Willow and her mother.</p>
<p>Clearly, teamwork is a metaphor for forgiveness because after this episode there isn&rsquo;t any more tension between Oz and Xander.</p>
<p>Sorry to bang on about Cordelia but now I remember why didn't like her much first time round; all I can remember is the horrible scenes she has in the second half of season three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It's just... This hall is about school, and you're about home. Mix them, my world dissolves.&rdquo; (Buffy obviously did well in chemistry)</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, I should say it's just beginning. Fight it if you want. Just remember, lift a finger against me, and you'll have to answer to MOO.&rdquo; &ldquo;Answer to MOO? Did that sentence just make some sense that I'm not in on?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mothers Opposed to the Occult. A powerful new group.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who came up with that lame name?&rdquo; &ldquo;That would be the founder. I believe you call her Mom' (Snyder is such a meanie and relishes these moments of superiority which he dishes out with such condescension)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, how would you know what I can do? I mean, the last time we had a conversation over three minutes, it was about the patriarchal bias of the Mr. Rogers Show.&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t get the reference but it&rsquo;s funny)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, I'm not acting out. I'm a witch! I can make pencils float. And I can summon the four elements. Okay, two, but four soon. And I'm dating a musician.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Willow!&rdquo; &ldquo;I worship Beelzebub. I do his biddings. Do you see any goats around? No, because I sacrificed them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Willow, please!&rdquo; &ldquo;All bow before Satan!&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm not listening to this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prince of Night, I summon you. Come fill me with your black, naughty evil.&rdquo; (&ldquo;black, naughty evil&rdquo; &ndash; both funny and shivery)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really win. The bad keeps coming back and getting stronger. Like that kid in the story, the boy that stuck his finger in the duck.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dyke.&rdquo; (look from Buffy) &ldquo;It's another word for dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go trade my cow in for some beans.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p><strong>Amends </strong>(Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>The bad hair and bad wig and bad ending fairies all paid a visit to this episode. Luckily the good Willow/Oz scene fairy was also on hand (twice).</p>
<p>First, someone's scissors must have slipped because Buffy's hair at various times through this episode is a horror.</p>
<p>Cordelia (or should I say Charisma) is shoved on for one of her (presumably obligatory contractual) appearances and she is just so bitchy and season one that I am pissed off with JW for doing this to her.</p>
<p>Oz and Willow make up and there's a "can you just be kissing me now?" moment or something like that ("do you want us to... to hug now?").</p>
<p><img id="image321" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/jenny-as-the-first.jpg" class="left" alt="The First as Jenny" />Angel is haunted and he's really quite good in these scenes (but not in the be-wigged flashbacks because nobody can act past that accent and those wigs). A visit from Jenny is always nice because Robia LaMorte is a pleasure to look at but The First seems to do an awful lot of touching "<a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?op=article&article_id=988906#top">No touching!</a>").<br clear="all"></p>
<p>The scene at Willy's bar with Xander being all "threatening" is a cringer.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be really hot but never does anyone look hot (except Jenny and Faith but that's a different hot) and that is not good direction or costuming (and we know that is often not good).</p>
<p>Willow tempts Oz but as usual Oz is far too sensible for a teen and says no, we'll wait until <em>I'm</em> ready, I mean, <em>we are</em>. Actually, this scene is the highlight of the episode with the bottle of fizzy drink in the cooler, the whole <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=3XCZ3C0tuyB&sa=X&oi=music&ct=result">Barry</a> thing working, Willow looking lovely and Oz being so damn sensible.</p>
<p>I think the scene on the hill is very powerful with some top acting but just as it's getting somewhere it bloody snows.</p>
<p>"Well, it must be that whole Angel killed his girlfriend and tortured him thing. Hey, Giles is pretty petty when it comes to stuff like that." (Please. When do I get to like Xander again?)</p>
<p>"Hello, still Jewish." (yes, we know, and we know you were gay in season five too)</p>
<p>""A child shall be born of man and goat and have two heads, and The First shall speak only in riddles" No wonder you like this stuff. It's like reading the Sun." (not <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29">The Sun</a></em> but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_%28supermarket_tabloid%29"><em>Sun</em></a>)</p>
<p>"Hmm. You think you can fight me? I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The First Evil. Beyond sin, beyond death. I am the thing the darkness fears. You'll never see me, but I am everywhere. Every being, every thought, every drop of hate." "All right, I get it. You're evil. Do we have to chat about it all day?" "Angel will be dead by sunrise. Your Christmas will be his wake." "No." "You have no idea what you're dealing with." "Let me guess. Is it evil?"</p>
<p>"I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes." (this line is meaningless if you think too hard about it)</p>

                  <p><strong>The Wish</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite episodes of <em>BtVS</em> and I consider it so highly that I forgive Marti Noxon for both <em>Bad Eggs</em> and <em>Dead Man's Party</em>. For just now, anyway.</p>
<p>Setting a story in an alternative universe, means you can do what you like to the characters (within plausibility) without any long-term repercussions. It is a concept that can only work when we have come to understand the characters and care about what happens to them even in this alternative universe. Contrast this with <em>The Zeppo</em> where it seemed that they were all in an alternative universe but the writers forgot to tell us.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image318" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/wish.jpg" alt="The end of the Wish" /></div>I&rsquo;m not going to go on about this episode because I&rsquo;ll just become incoherent. Suffice to say that the death of Cordelia with an anguished Giles looking helplessly on is only surpassed in this episode by the breaking of Buffy&rsquo;s neck by the Master. The way she lifelessly sways and drops is more of a gut-wrencher than her real death in <em>The Gift</em>. <br clear="all"/><br />
<img id="image316" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/the-death-of-cordelia.jpg" class="left" alt="The death of Cordelia" />Xander and Willow killing Cordelia is powerful and shocking. There is something perverse about Xander pulling Willow further towards Cordelia&rsquo;s neck.<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Anya seems to perk up at the notion that Xander is marginally cooler just before Cordelia makes her fateful wish.</p>
<p>There are two clunky bits of dialogue which written down don&rsquo;t seem so bad but maybe Nick Brendon&rsquo;s teeth made it difficult for him to deliver them well: "You love all the parts." and "We really are living in a golden age."</p>
<p>Dialogue to relish:</p>
<p>"Look, I'm sorry this is hard for you. But I told you what I need. So, I can't help feeling like the reason you want to talk is so you can feel better about yourself. That's not my problem."  - the way <a href="http://www.sethgreenonline.com/">Seth Green</a> as Oz delivers this makes it seem much less harsh and makes Oz seem like the wisest teenager ever.</p>
<p>"That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?"</p>
<div class="imagebox-left"><img id="image319" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/anya.jpg" alt="Anya in The Wish" /><br/>"Still, I mean... Don't you kinda wish...?"</div><br clear="all"/></p>
<p>"<a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-wbored.wav">Bored now</a>"</p>
<p>"Hmm. Buffy. Ooo. Scary." "Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear in nobody's hearts."</p>
<p>"Why don't I just put a stake through her heart?" "She's not a vampire." "Mm, well, you'd be surprised how many things that'll kill." - Buffy is extremely Faith like in this episode...</p>
<p>"World is what it is. We fight. We die. Wishing doesn't change that." "I have to believe in a better world." "Go ahead. I have to live in this one."</p>

Her new album <em>Now It's Time</em> is out at the end of February and if the two tracks on her <a href="  http://www.myspace.com/paulafrazer  ">MySpace</a> space are anything to go by it is is going to sound as majestic as ever.

                  <p><strong>Lovers Walk</strong> (<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0891551/">Dan Vebber</a>)</p>
<p>"Well, I think this is great! Now you can leave and never come back!" "Well, I mean that in a positive way. Get out of Sunnydale. That's a good thing. What kind of moron would ever wanna come back here?" and in one of <em>BtVS</em>'s frequent "ironic segue fairy" cuts Spike arrives in town which is a good thing (but only in single episode doses). (Actually, that cut isn't ironic so let's call it the clunky segue fairy.) As an aside, I have to confess to reading Television Without Pity's <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/articles/category_1227.html">recaps</a> but only for the episodes that I don't mind them being mean about.</p>
<p><img id="image311" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/willow-and-spike.jpg" class="left" alt="Willow and Spike in Lovers Walk" />Spike murders the magic shop woman and we still laugh at him. He&rsquo;s threatening Willow with a bottle and a few minutes later he's amusing us. I'm confused by this. The scene with Willow listening to Spike go on about Drusilla (as if we really care) is very odd; (a cold) Willow sits there looking awkward (rather than terrified), occasionally touching her mouth, and it must be the longest scene in which Willow is silenced (excluding <em>Hush</em>, <em>of course</em>) except for a hilarious "there, there". Spike proceeds to bore Joyce but when Angel turns up, his gesturing behind Joyce is priceless.<img id="image309" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/joyce-and-spike.jpg" alt="Joyce and Spike in Lovers Walk" /></p>
<p>Why is Willow attempting to keep the spell a secret? Reviewing season three has made me more aware of the less savoury aspects of Willow's character: her cheating, lying and secrecy all build up to season six. And by not telling Xander, she is also behaving in a controlling way; she thinks it's better for him not to know and it&rsquo;s always better for Willow not to confront emotional difficulties.</p>
<p>Oz is able to locate Willow by smell: the smell of fear and not the smell of "<a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/caps/thumbnails.php?album=78&page=6">hugs</a>" this time. "It's Willow. She's nearby." "What? You can smell her? She doesn't even wear perfume." "She's afraid." "Oh, my God. Is this some sort of residual werewolf thing? This is very disturbing." "I really agree."</p>
<p>Buffy doesn't like what Angel has to say about her leaving to go to college though by the end of the episode with a little advice from the unlikely source of Spike she has to agree that she shouldn't see Angel.</p>
<p>Here's some things I really, really didn't like:</p>
<p>Oh dear Lord: it's season six "You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love 'til it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 'til it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children, it's blood, blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it."</p>
<p><img id="image308" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/cordelia.jpg" class="left" alt="Cordelia in Lovers Walk" />Cordelia and Oz discover Willow and Xander kissing (though even during kissing, you'd think they'd hear the door open) and Cordelia's character development is set to vanish after the conclusion of the next episode. Poor Cordelia, I had come to like her a lot and to appreciate Charisma Carpenter's performance. It's a shame that for the next few episodes she is reduced to caricature again.</p>
<p>The funeral-that-isn't-Cordelia&rsquo;s device is so cheesy and naff and used too often by Whedon and co (even in <em>Firefly</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/articles/content/a3854/index-15.html"><em>Serenity</em></a> when we think Kaylee is dead in...)</p>
<p>Some things I did like:</p>
<p>"Well, I can see why you'd be upset. That was my sarcastic voice." "You know, it sounds a lot like your regular voice." "I've been told that."</p>
<p>"They don't stand a chance. I'm really good. Or I used to be, when they had the inflatable things in the gutters."</p>
<p>"This is just so thoughtful." " Well, I think about you." Oh, I don't have anything to give you." "Yeah, you do." - the pez witch is just such a sweet gift</p>
<p>There is a delightful scene with the mayor and Allan - "Loose cannon. Rock the boat. Is that a mixed metaphor?"</p>
<p>While Buffy is highly amused by Giles' preparations, she takes a compass and uses the mirror to look at herself.</p>
