                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency"</strong> (Robin Veith &amp; Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2369" title="Mad Men - Joan closes the light" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Mad-Men-S03E06.jpg" alt="Mad Men - Joan closes the light" width="500" height="406" /></p>
<p>What an episode.</p>
<p>Random observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jared Harris made me think of of his dad, Richard, as Dumbledore when he addressed the whole office.</li>
<li>The title of this episode is cheeky.</li>
<li>I write a blog post about how humourless the show is and then this comes along. It was extremely funny.</li>
<li>Joan is a great character. And Christina Hendricks makes her even more compelling. This episode showed that the entire series could be about her. Her scene with her husband where she tries very hard to make him feel better was riveting. The actor who plays Greg (Sam Page) was pretty good in scene too.</li>
<li>Don and Joan have such extraordinary chemistry. And Christina said the following lines perfectly:</li><br />
</ul></p>
<blockquote><p>But that&rsquo;s life. One minute you&rsquo;re on top of the world, the next minute some secretary&rsquo;s running you over with a lawn mower.</blockquote></p>
<ul>
<li>Peggy desperately trying to talk to Joan was frustrating because she didn't say what she wanted to say before...</li>
<li>The riding mower incident was very close to being a jump the shark moment but I think they pulled it off. I think the guy playing Guy was brilliant in his agony and seeing Joan in full efficiency mode was wonderful.</li>
<li>Betty gets a lot of flak for being a poor mother. What I think many people fail to see is that she is quite an ordinary mother because, guess what, mothering isn't something we can do perfectly just because we have a vagina. She tries and she sometimes fails. What we rarely see (never?) on the show is her parenting triumphs.</li>
<li>I see a bit of my parenting in Betty. I lose my temper and get frustrated and it takes Andy to step in and defuse the situation. And that happens the other way around too.</li>
<li>Betty accepts Sally's apology rather sweetly, however, that is rather overshadowed by Don's parenting triumph in the conclusion to this episode.</li>
<li>Pete catches Peggy when she faints.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>I love the exchange between Guy and Pete. It is hard to tell which part of Guy's statement that Pete is referring to.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Guy</strong>: I know everything about you. You&rsquo;re a very impressive fellow.<br />
<strong>Pete</strong>: I wish I could return the compliment.</blockquote></p>
<ul>
<li>Don looked like California Don in the first scene he has with Sally.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>Don and Betty have a normal conversation when she offers him leftovers for his tea and he asks her if he would like to go to London. They actually seemed like a normal couple for a while eating Ritz crackers and drinking Budweiser.</li>
<li>Roger had the best line:</li><br />
</ul></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Paul</strong>: He might lose his foot.<br />
<strong>Roger</strong>: Right when he got it in the door.</blockquote></p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't really understand why Guy's career in advertising was over. Douglas Bader lost more than a foot and he managed to fight in the Battle of Britain. However, in light of the fact that Lane was asked to remove his glasses when he met the other English executives seems to indicate an intolerance of imperfection which is an odd characterisation of the English.</li>
<li>I may have got over my fear of Ken. I think he may just be an uncomplicated fellow.</li><br />
</ul></p>

                  <p><strong>First Date</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="First Date - Dawn holds up gruesome drawing made by Giles" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2489/3947421805_1aa14f173b_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" /></p>
<p>I almost said to Andy before it started that this episode was likely to be one of the worse ever because all I could remember was that Xander had a date and that she was played by a pop star I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of then, never mind now.</p>
<p>However, except for Xander&rsquo;s dire story this was a fun episode. Poor Xander, his story was plainly daft and poorly acted. Just what this random demon was going to do with the ubervamp wasn&rsquo;t adequately explained and highlights a problem that periodically reoccurs in <em>Buffy</em> in which something which had been so crucial or so important or so precious at one point is then treated cavalierly later. And just how Xander sent Willow that text message will remain a mystery.</p>
<p>Actually, I have just remembered something worse than Xander&rsquo;s story and that was the stupidity of Giles and Chao-Ahn. Yeah, Giles would definitely be that oafish and the jokes were just silly, no, just cheap and wince inducing. Why would she eat ice cream if she was lactose intolerant?</p>
<p>Oh dear, that just leaves Buffy and Robin. And Andrew and the First. Luckily it&rsquo;s Buffy&rsquo;s story and she got the majority of screen time, but I have to admit that now I have reached a peaceful state regarding Andrew&rsquo;s presence on the show I think he is generally quite appealing. Ow, my expectations have dropped. I blame <em>Angel</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the best things in the show involved Buffy. I particularly enjoyed the scene of Willow balling socks (exciting day on the set for Ms Hannigan) and the conversation they have. Any dialogue that mentions a bidet of evil is just class. Willow laughing at Buffy and her counselling skills was cruel but amusing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="First Date - Willow makes a face" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/3947422439_66e7068f0c_o.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" /></p>
<p>I keep reading the transcript and I keep coming across stuff I don&rsquo;t like. I don&rsquo;t mind Anya being jealous but I detest the use of &ldquo;whore&rdquo; and &ldquo;slut&rdquo;. Anya&rsquo;s role is so shitty these days.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Giles&rsquo;s gruesome flashcards were a treat. And this is what I do like about <em>Buffy</em>, this is like whizzing back to &ldquo;Hush&rdquo; and his presentation in the lecture theatre.</p>
<p>Buffy is struck dumb by the realization that Principal Wood is a white-hat and says it all by saying nothing.</p>
<p>I remember being greatly excited when Robin was told that Spike killed his mother. Oh, revenge. How thrilling.</p>

                <article>
                  
                  <p>Two blog posts from outside my usual <em>Mad Men</em> sphere brought me up short when I read them and made me think: do I actually like <em>Mad Men</em>?</p>
<p>It can be hard work and it is dour and oppressive. The sixties weren't that miserable. Self-Styled Siren <a href="http://selfstyledsiren.blogspot.com/2009/09/ten-melos-siren-would-watch-instead-of.html">has a post</a> on the whole <em>dour</em>ness of it and suggests watching films from the period instead. Now, I find it hard to like or, indeed, find films from that era so I'm not so sure though I guess <em>North By Northwest</em> could be a good start (ok, not a melodrama). It is, after all, also about an incredibly handsome ad executive... I'm wittering but I do think the Siren sums it up succinctly: "It's like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Saint Augustine</a> wrote the scripts."</p>
<p>Lance Mannion <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2009/08/all-the-mad-men-and-all-the-mad-women-cant-tell-a-joke-to-save-their-lives.html">goes further</a> and criticises the show's lack of humour. And while I think Pete is hilarious, he does have a point: "It's a comedy with all the jokes removed" and "Mad Men is one of the most relentlessly and deliberately humorless shows in the history of television drama".</p>
<p>(He is incorrect about none of the characters being musically inclined because we know Paul is a singer and that Joan can play the accordion - but she isn't an ad woman (but should be) - however, his blog post predates "My Old Kentucky Home".)</p>
<p>Well, I do like <em>Mad Men</em>, nay love it, but I can't help but thinking it would be even <em>better</em> if there was more <em>scherzando</em> like the scene when Pete and Trudy danced in every episode.</p>

                  <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2336" title="Mad Men - The Fog - Betty" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Mad-Men-The-Fog-Betty.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The Fog - Betty" width="500" height="252" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> &ndash; &ldquo;The Fog&rdquo;</strong> (Kater Gordon*)</p>
<p>*the first episode this season not co-written by Matthew Weiner</p>
<p>This was an excellent episode chock full of great moments and scenes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already bored with Don&rsquo;s relationship with the teacher, Suzanne. The worst thing about &ldquo;The Fog&rdquo; was her unlikeliness, her modernity, her empathy, her touching (oi, get your mitts off), and her razzled phonecall. The only bright spot involving Suzanne is when she asked why the Drapers didn&rsquo;t call the school or send a note about Sally&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s death which allowed me to cry in reaffirmation that &ldquo;they are terrible parents&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I also felt the conversation between Don and the prison guard (with a suspiciously modern looking number one haircut) was heavy-handed. Yes, we get it, Don is a poor father and a poor husband.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s fog was nasty stuff and the birthing scenes emphasised her childishness because she was treated like someone who can&rsquo;t be trusted to make informed decisions. It all seemed pretty believable to me though I don&rsquo;t get why fathers stayed at the hospital at all when they weren&rsquo;t expected to partake in the joy of bringing a new life into the world. The average labour for a second/third pregnancy is 6-8 hours so most daddies to be were in for a long, long wait.</p>
<p>Aran, a commentator at Basket of Kisses <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2009/09/13/new-baby/#comment-52001">noted</a> that Don is not seen at any time to touch or hold his new son which is a point worth reiterating.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s reluctant getting up in the middle of the night for her new child was only the beginning of it. I remember the first few weeks being absolute hell. Perhaps, after the initial euphoria they were actually the worst few weeks of my life and I had the absolute support of my husband. Of course, nobody expected men to help back then. A point made strongly in this episode when Don is reprimanded for taking half a day off work.</p>
<p>Peggy and Pete are such interesting characters and are, by a long distance, my current favourites.</p>
<p>Pete brings out Peggy&rsquo;s funny side though I suspect he wouldn&rsquo;t agree. I love her brittleness when they are together.</p>
<p>I was distinctly underwhelmed when I realised that Duck was to make an appearance in this but his dealings with Peggy and Pete made for a couple of great scenes.</p>
<p>Note Pete&rsquo;s concern when he thought it was his Uncle Herman on the phone. I loved Pete&rsquo;s indignation when he saw Peggy at Duck&rsquo;s table and whether he only stormed off because Duck wasn&rsquo;t courting him alone, he was right to storm off. Pete&rsquo;s conversation with Hollis was cringeworthy and hilarious. And Pete&rsquo;s natural charm (well, I see it) came through in the end when they both smiled at the baseball mention. I think I would appreciate Pete&rsquo;s idea of integrated ads if I knew exactly what they were.</p>
<p>In reality, I think Peggy would take the first opportunity to leave Sterling Cooper but, since I guess it is unlikely that we will be spending screen time in another ad agency, she isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. Her scene with Don was marvellous though I do think she could made more of the paperclips remark to protest that she brought more to the firm than wee bits of metal. I don&rsquo;t think she was deliberately manipulative when she stared at and touched the bootees but it certainly got Don&rsquo;s attention though maybe Peggy telling him he had everything might have made wish he had stopped listening. Don asked his favourite question &ldquo;what do you want me to say?&rdquo; and Peggy&rsquo;s reply &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could have been any clearer&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;what if this is my time?&rdquo; was tense stuff.</p>
