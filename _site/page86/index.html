                  <p>In "The Attic" episode of <em>Dollhouse</em>, there were cans of London Pride (brewed a few miles from my part of London) on the shelves in Clyde's hideout.</p>

                  <p>This blog hasn't died. It may be hibernating a little bit.</p>
<p>I may start "reviewing" <em>Buffy</em> in January when we start rewatching it with Adam. He has only seen a handful of episodes from before S4 and maybe by the time we get to S6 he'll be able to stand Spuffy. Though...I don't see why he should when I can't, but at least he may be physically able to watch it rather than giving up in dismay when Spike and Buffy started snogging regularly (and anyway, there were episodes in S6 that a 12 year old shouldn't watch).</p>
<p>We finished <em>Angel</em> and thank you, Andy, for struggling along with me as we negotiated the final season. I may have fallen out of love with Joss Whedon and coupled with the unravelling of <em>Dollhouse</em>, I have become increasing more estranged from the fandom which adores all that he does (and I thought I was one of them too...). I see terrible dialogue, awkward exposition, two dull leads, fine actors struggling with their lines, illogical plotting, a villain motivated by jealousy (which, admittedly, was good enough for Shakespeare but bores me in the '<em>House</em>), fake out deaths, etc, and I don't like it very much. I do love Enver Gjokaj (and his hilarious turn as Topher did reveal it is Topher I can't stand not Fran Kranz so apologies to him) and Olivia Williams (but even she falters over the poor dialogue at times and her costuming is unflattering and makes her look like she frequents <a href="http://www.bhs.co.uk/mall/departmentpage.cfm/bhsstore/198706/1/1">Bhs</a>) and I am grateful that I get to see them on my screen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/2009/12/1x06.jpg" alt="1x06" title="1x06" width="450" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2585" /><br />
We have started watching <em>Carniv&agrave;le</em> and, despite the nagging doubts I have over what is unresolved at the end of S2, I do like it a lot. Nick Stahl is a little lightweight as Ben but the rest of the cast are wonderful. I particularly like Patrick Bauchau as Lodz, Michael J. Anderson as Samson and Clancy Brown as Justin, and I have liked Clea DuVall since "Out of Mind, Out of Sight" and it is refreshing to have a leading lady who looks like somebody you might meet in real life. The last episode we watched "Pick a Number" had a devastatingly horrible ending with Dora Mae being left in Babylon to be raped for eternity. The photography is stunning, the music superb and the theme is most unusual. I like the fact it is a period piece and the atmosphere of the carnival is well presented.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>ETA: <em>Mad Men</em>! What a show. Love it. Read and absorbed too much to write about the final episodes with any degree of originality but best show on TV by far. It wasn't always satisfactory (Miss Farrell for a start) and a few characters were neglected but always gripping.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "A Hole in the World"</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>This is a disjointed rant about the episode in which Fred (I mean, Winifred Burkle) became a saint. And another woman died (and RIP Cordelia Chase).</p>
<blockquote><p>ANGEL Good. Guys...<br />
WESLEY You don't have to say it.<br />
ANGEL I'll say it anyway. Winifred Burkle. Go.</blockquote></p>
<p>Astonishingly, <em>Angel</em> S5 has not been a patch on S4 (actually not so astonishingly since I like Cordy and Charisma Carpenter and I, sort of, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">like</span> love Vincent Kartheiser) and now it is <em>actually</em> rehashing storylines from that season. </p>
<p>"A Hole in the World" was manipulative beyond belief. I think my view of the episode is coloured by my continuing dismay with the Whedon theme of getting a couple together, making them really happy for a short time (often a really short time - like an episode) and then making them really unhappy, usually by killing one of them. If Wesley and Fred had been a couple for longer then I might have cared for his grief.</p>
<p>I would complain that Gunn, who was with her for over a year, wasn't at her bedside but, since they had zero chemistry then and subsequently, I had practically forgotten they had ever been a couple until Wesley asked Gunn if he was okay with them going out.</p>
<p>Andy and I were shocked by Wesley shooting a man in the knee. It might have been intended to be funny and I wonder if it was supposed to be that. Maybe it was another thing that I will come on to in a moment but, whatever, I seriously maintain it is one of the most outrageously stupid and offensive things I have seen in the Whedonverse (and that includes Mal kicking a man into a spaceship engine in "The Train Job") and then Lorne hit Eve. Andy said something must be manipulating them and that is, of course, true but not quite in the way he meant.</p>
<p>Lorne hit Eve and why? Because Fred was so fan-bleeding-tastic. So wonderful, that peace-loving Lorne punched Eve because she said the words "why would we even care about her?"</p>
<p>Wesley's behaviour could be viewed as manly behaviour because there were other incidents in the episode that made it feel like a parody of macho attitudes <em>except</em> that it wasn't a parody. The low angle shot of Angel and Spike exiting the office after the line "Come on. Let's save the day" was one incident as was the bonding between Spike and Angel because nothing gets men more riled up and heroic in clich&eacute; land than womenfolk getting murdered.</p>
<p>On and on, furthermore, Wesley was saddled with a dreadful lines about loving Fred <em>before</em> he met her. This means he loved an ideal woman not a real woman as Strega and Joanna <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/angel/a_hole_in_the_world.php?page=21">pointed out over at TWoP</a>.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned the <em>Aliens</em> shoutout (which I suppose Joss is sort of allowed to reference) and the icky snogging at the beginning? And this classic line from Lorne (in a show with the only kind of gods being those with small gs) "If nobody thinks it's too ridiculous, I'm going to pray."</p>
<p>To be generous, I'm not sentimental so a sentimental episode about a woman dying (who I didn't really have any time for except in "The Magic Bullet" when Fred actually did stuff) and the woeful efforts by her boys to try and save her was never really going to get to me. I kept muttering "where's the puppets?" throughout.[caption id="attachment_2569" align="aligncenter" width="533" caption="She looks nice with blue hair."]<img src="/images/uploads/2009/11/AHitW.jpg" alt="She looks nice with blue hair." title="A Hole in the World - Illyria" width="533" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-2569" />[/caption]</p>
<p>*<small>no, you just can't because your character wasn't going anywhere and the obvious answer wasn't to make your character more interesting and complex (and by complex, I don't mean adding yet another scientific skill to your already impressive list) but was to kill you.</small></p>

<p><a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/?p=2529">This</a> was quite obviously my final episode review of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>. I started this &ldquo;project&rdquo; in (no, really?) on <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2006/04/20/its-almost-but-not-like-watching-it-for-the-first-time/">20th April 2006</a> (when I was 41) and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself along the way. I am greatly chuffed by the number of people who have taken the time to make comments which were without exception more thoughtful and analytical than I ever managed. (I defend myself by pointing out that I never thought I was being smart.)</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://www.englishchick.com/joan.htm">Joan the English Chick</a> and the other folks who transcribed all the episodes, the folks over at <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/?page_id=2">Screencap Paradise</a> whose screencaps saved me a lot of time, and all the <a href="http://www.criticallytouched.com/buffy/reviews.php">bloggers</a> and <a href="http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> keepers who have given me so much to think about. I am in awe of their <a href="http://gabrielleabelle.livejournal.com/">talent</a> and insight.</p>
<p>I have now watched every episode twice and some I have seen many, many times (and there are more that I have seen parts of many, many times). However, if I want to spend another three and a bit years of my life doing another rewatch, I will only watch S1-4 again and selected episodes from 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<p>S5 is where it gets &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; and where, too often, it fails to match its ambition and is disappointingly unengaging and unconvincing.</p>
<p>My favourite characters are Willow and Tara and, while I adore S4 Tara and Willow, too often thereafter they are a rather boring couple.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly great episodes after S4 but overall the seasons are troublesome and I have to put it down to one thing: Spike gets a crush on Buffy. I loved evil Spike and chipped Spike but, after he fell for Buffy, I became irritated as the show focused on Spike and his relationship with Buffy. I am not that interested in any of my heroines' relationships with their significant others. The great thing about Buffy and Angel was that when they did get together it unleashed Angelus which put the kibosh on romance (for the most part).</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons I loved Tara and Willow&rsquo;s burgeoning relationship was precisely because it was obscured by metaphors. The explicit course of the relationship between Kennedy and Willow was a literal turn-off for me. Even Oz and Willow's relationship was sweet and somewhat na&iuml;ve which made it endearing (and they became boring too). And, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t Willow's show and we weren't treated to episode after episode exploring her relationships.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </em>in one word, I would call it layered. It is fluffy, profound, funny, heartbreaking, silly, serious, exciting, sad, entertaining, thought-provoking, groundbreaking, and add your own. It also boasted sensational outfits because ultimately that is what mattered*.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2527" align="aligncenter" width="535" caption="Willow&#39;s top is so awful that it makes Tara&#39;s look nice"]<img class="size-full wp-image-2527" title="After Life - the worst top ever?" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/After-Life-the-worst-top-ever.jpg" alt="Willow's top is so awful that it makes Tara's look nice" width="535" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>*<small>Or maybe what really mattered was friendship and family because when you lose your friends and family you get S7.</small></p>

<strong>Chosen</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chosen&rdquo; is not the best season finale (seasons 2, 3 and 5 have better ones) but it is an adequate way to end the entire series. I have major issues with the empowerment spell and with the huge role that Spike plays in the conclusion and that taints it for me.</p>
<p>Joss Whedon has this to say about Buffy&rsquo;s cookie dough speech: &ldquo;She comes to this conclusion a little bit out of the blue, and that's my fault, but we knew that emotionally, that's where we wanted her to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this about the Scythe: &ldquo;Some people have complained that the magic that this Scythe &ndash; originally from the <em>Fray</em> comic that I was writing at the same time &ndash; is a little too convenient. And my answer to those critics is, "Well, don't tell everybody!" It is convenient, and that doesn't really bother me, because ultimately, to me, the magic, the <a href="http://www.triviaguide.net/phlebotnum/">phlebotnum</a> is always secondary to what needs to be said. And what needed to be said had to do with empowerment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this about the Ubervamps: &ldquo;Some people complained, again, that the vampires were too easy to kill. That they were supposed to be stronger than other vampires. And the fact of the matter is&hellip; it's true. Like the convenience of the magic, it's true. Because, again, I was more interested in showing the empowerment than I was in the continuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three quotes from Joss Whedon&rsquo;s commentary to &lsquo;Chosen&rdquo; (transcript by <a href="http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/53253.html">stormwreath</a>) make it clear that he doesn&rsquo;t care if a story is a little strained if the story being told has heart. However, what happens if the heart is in the wrong place?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2538" title="Chosen - Anya" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Anya.jpg" alt="Chosen - Anya" width="534" height="300" /><br />
This is what he says about Anya: &ldquo;That was because I needed a toll, I needed this battle really to feel like a battle &ndash; and I couldn't kill any of my Core Four and still call it a happy ending. I couldn't kill Dawn and still call it a happy ending either. So Anya got the nod. And to make it as unheroic as possible just felt very real and very creepy &ndash; and that shot was in fact her last shot.&rdquo; (I like that Anya was steeled by the thought of bunnies but, otherwise, just another woman to add to the pile.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2539" title="Chosen - Spike" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Spike.jpg" alt="Chosen - Spike" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what he says about Spike: &ldquo;Another beautiful image. Our boy, going down for the last time. Even though everybody already knew he was going to be on <em>Angel</em>...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t! I thought he was bloody dead. And answer this question: who gets to die in a literal blaze of glory and whose body is left buried under Sunnydale? Many people die in <em>Buffy</em> and, in a series with a disproportionate amount of female characters (compared with any other TV series that is), many of them are women. What I resent is the number of women who die compared with the number of men who leave rather than get killed off. And this Spike thing is even more galling. He dies (completely incinerated) and yet there he is in bloody <em>Angel</em>. Joss is famous for his character deaths which are tremendously resonant and powerfully effective which some people justify by pointing out that death happens and is even more likely to be early and violent in the Buffyverse (this is undeniable) but when the deceased return from the dead then where is the power in that?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2543" title="Chosen - Willow " src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Willow.jpg" alt="Chosen - Willow " width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I have problems with the empowerment of thousands of young potentials; not with the ones that Buffy explicitly asks if they want to do this thing (&ldquo;So here's the part where you make a choice&hellip;&rdquo;) but with the ones who have it thrust upon them. It is done without their consent. How is Buffy different from the Shadow Men who did the same to the first Slayer? When she met them in &ldquo;Get It Done&rdquo; she is miffed with what they did to the First Slayer &ldquo;You violated that girl, made her kill for you because you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few other remarks:</p>
<p>If you are going to use lines like &ldquo;he had to split&rdquo;, it really helps when the character then laughs at its cheesiness.</p>
<p>Dawn kicking Buffy in the shin is acceptable violence.</p>
<p>Spike's drawing of Angel on the punchbag is amusing.</p>
<p>I liked Robin and Faith together. Faith&rsquo;s horror at, perhaps, not being that great at sex was most amusing ("Dude, I got mad skills."). However, I don&rsquo;t like Robin&rsquo;s &ldquo;death&rdquo;. Back to Joss: &ldquo;Dying &ndash; having a character die then suddenly bringing them back is something you can only earn after you've actually killed a couple of people. So this was a nice opportunity to say, "This isn&rsquo;t over yet." Have the call-back and &ndash; but I wouldn't have been able to do it if I hadn't legitimately offed a few beloved characters.&rdquo; I really detest that fake-out storytelling: it feels like cheating to me and is also a tad repetitive since it had already been done to Cordelia and Kaylee.</p>
<p>Giles and the others playing Dungeons and Dragons was also amusing particularly since he summed up his S7 persona: "I used to be a highly respected watcher, and      now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily."</p>
<p>After reading Joss&rsquo;s words, I should know better than to complain but Buffy&rsquo;s plan could really have done with better timing like waiting for Willow&rsquo;s spell to, um, work.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2541" title="Chosen - buffy, xander, giles, willow" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-the-four.jpg" alt="Chosen - buffy, xander, giles, willow" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I love the lull before the final fight as other characters disappear to get on with their tasks leaving the original four in the high school corridor and a shot of Buffy on her own: Giles&rsquo;s remark the &ldquo;earth is definitely doomed&rdquo; is a perfect reminder of&nbsp; &ldquo;The Harvest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What happens to Kennedy? I&rsquo;m pretty sure we never see her after the escape from the Hellmouth. It seems a bit odd not to have a proper shot of her on the bus.</p>
<p>The Welcome to Sunnydale sigh falling into the crater is an important touch.</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s last words are &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spike&rdquo; which surely somebody has analysed the significance of.</p>
<p>In the final, final scene, I like that Buffy doesn&rsquo;t say anything while everyone yammers but just smiles, sadly.</p>
