										<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Gray Hour"</strong> (Sarah Fain &amp; Elizabeth Craft)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1545" title="dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle.jpg" alt="dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle" width="533" height="267" /></p>
<p>I vowed to myself that if I disliked this episode of <em>Dollhouse</em> as much as &ldquo;Stage Fright&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t blog about it because I really didn&rsquo;t like writing about it at all.</p>
<p>This started off with heavy breathing which of course made us all roll our eyes only to find ourselves confounded by a woman in labour and Echo as doula. Quite why she was a doula in a remote location can only be explained by the symbolism throughout the rest of the episode. I don&rsquo;t care anymore if something is implausible; I&rsquo;m giving up worrying about that.</p>
<p>Eliza Dushku was at her best (so far in the series) as the reset Echo who comes to in a horrible place where men slap her. She made her can I go nows rather affecting. In addition, her awakening after her doula mission seemed more aware and less mechanical then usual.</p>
<p>Some folk complain that they are fed up with comparisons being made between ED and Dichen Lachman. However, when they play the exact same imprint I think a comparison is only fair and DL wins.</p>
<p>I also really like Enver Gjokaj as Victor/Lubov. I hope he keeps up this level of charm.</p>
<p>The scenes before we realised that Echo was Taffytastic were particularly unpleasant: multiple rape and the threat of further rape were just nasty and hard to take. I hope that as the series takes off in <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eliza-dushku,24418/">episode 6</a> that this kind of scene is dropped. I would also like the now unquestioningly <a href="http://thelaverytory.blogspot.com/2009/03/blog-post.html">gratuitous shots of ED in her bra to stop too</a>.</p>
<p>Topher is mostly over the top, but as others have wondered, is he OTT or is Fran Kranz? I&rsquo;m going for the former for the moment.</p>
<p>I have determined that Olivia Williams has decided that subtle acting has no place in the <em>Dollhouse</em>:</p>

      <div class="comment-content">Hmmm, one of the few times I really disagree with you.  I really disliked her post-wipe acting.  And, I thought Dichen Lachman was terrible as Taffy.  Eliza wasn't great, but there was some warmth in the personality; it didn't feel nearly as plastic and constructed as Lachman.  

I could actually imagine ED's Taffy as a real person (barely).  There is no way in a million years I'd buy DL's.</div>

      <div class="comment-content">Yeah, usually we seem to agree on everything so it was weird when I read that you seemed to have totally opposite reactions this time.

If it wasn't a Joss show, I'm not convinced I would spend any more time with it.  That said, it is a Joss show and I think they've got a lot of stuff building slowly that could be very interesting and I have some faith that it will actually come good.

I can spare an hour a week to find out.  For awhile at least.</div>
