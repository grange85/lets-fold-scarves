                  <p><strong>Seeing Red</strong> (Steven S. DeKnight)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1648" title="seeing-red-amber benson in the credits" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/seeing-red-ab-credits.jpg" alt="seeing-red-amber benson in the credits" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>The teaser finishes and straight away I&rsquo;m calling the makers of <em>Buffy</em> bastards as Amber Benson appears in the credits.</p>
<p>Andy and I had a very long discussion about this episode after we watched it.</p>
<p>[Followed by a discussion about the implications of&nbsp; &ldquo;Normal Again&rdquo; and sexual violence on TV and particularly in <em>Mad Men</em>.]</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1647" title="seeing-red-buffy-and-spike" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/seeing-red-buffy-and-spike.jpg" alt="seeing-red-buffy-and-spike" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>We discussed the ambiguity of Spike&rsquo;s attempted rape of Buffy. If Spike was human and if Buffy was an ordinary woman and if they hadn&rsquo;t been involved in a violent abusive relationship then there would be no ambiguity. It seems an appropriately sad and tacky culmination to the Buffy and Spike relationship. The fade to black for an advert break was pretty outrageous though. I hadn&rsquo;t actually given the incident any thought at any time because I was distracted by the other important event so it made a change to consider it.</p>
<p>I asked Andy for his reaction to Tara&rsquo;s death (I hesitate to call it murder when manslaughter seems more appropriate) bearing in mind that Andy isn&rsquo;t an obsessive Tara fan and doesn&rsquo;t read much about the show. He felt her death was undramatic and that the sex and the kissing and the intimacy were in poor taste considering what unfolds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650" title="seeing-red-willow-and-tara" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/seeing-red-willow-and-tara.jpg" alt="seeing-red-willow-and-tara" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I can only agree.</p>
<p>I find it really hard to separate my thoughts about Tara&rsquo;s death based on season 6 alone and those based on subsequent events (or non-events) because they are all tangled up together.</p>
<p>The way season 6 was designed means that Tara&rsquo;s death is necessary for Willow to go dark. Buffy or Xander wouldn&rsquo;t have done. It had to be a lover. It could have been Oz. They could have cheated and had Willow think Tara was dead when she wasn&rsquo;t but that wouldn&rsquo;t be dramatically satisfactory. If Tara has to die why is it so undramatic?</p>
<p>They have just back to together, they are a hot sexy couple (who knew?), they appear to be happy and in one measly episode it&rsquo;s over. Tara was interesting. She had a relationship with Buffy, She even had friends (do any of the other Scoobies have friends? Real friends? Janice. Gotcha.) If Tara had been offed in season 5 who exactly would have cared? I may have just understood why Tara is interesting in season 6 &ndash; so we can miss her.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1651" align="aligncenter" width="535" caption="And all the winds go sighing, for sweet things dying. "]<img class="size-full wp-image-1651" title="seeing-red-your-shirt" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/seeing-red-your-shirt.jpg" alt="And all the winds go sighing, for sweet things dying. " width="535" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>I do know one concrete reason why I dislike her death so much and that is because it is so unbelievable. The scriptwriters (or just Steven S. DeKnight) know they have to kill her but they don&rsquo;t take any care to make it plausible. She hugs Willow and impossibly sees Xander arrive in the garden. Warren&rsquo;s final shot must have taken the amazing ricochets to enter her body the way it does (it looks as if it&rsquo;s horizontal and as if it was directly fired at her) to kill her instantly and to splatter her blood over her lover.</p>
<p>I have read that the ricochets aren&rsquo;t actually impossible but to a layperson who knows nothing about guns it <em>seems</em> impossible. If they had been in the kitchen then I would be placated but then if they had been in the kitchen then the whole sex and then death thing wouldn&rsquo;t be there to rankle.</p>
<p>Putting Amber Benson in the credits suggests a lack of respect to the character (and to the actor&hellip;). I often wonder about that. I think it speaks volumes of an unknown nature that AB didn&rsquo;t come back for &lsquo;Conversations With Dead People&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall ever know the complete story but Amber if you are reading this&hellip;!</p>
<p>It is so lame in many respects. Warren was a genius because he was the first person to realise the most likely way to kill a Slayer is to shoot her.</p>
<p>The lovey-doveyness in the episode doesn&rsquo;t assuage my discomfit at Tara returning to her violator. Willow may be off the drugs but she hasn&rsquo;t muttered a word of apology for what she did. It may have happened off screen but I guess it wasn&rsquo;t deemed important enough to show us.</p>
<p>I have never seen a single minute of any of the rest of season 6 and all of season 7 since my initial dazed and rushed viewing. It will be interesting to see if I can watch the rest without seething over my other problems with Tara&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Also: poor Jonathan. He was betrayed by Warren and what&rsquo;s his name who is such a weasel. In spite of myself I do laugh at the antics of the Trio. The jetpacks were stupidly OTT but it was funny to see Andrew hit the roof.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that I haven't written a more profound entry on this episode but that's the way it goes I suppose. Thanks Amber, thanks Tara and thanks to Joss, Marti and co for creating her.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "The Man on the Street" </strong>(Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>This is a series that I now want to watch rather than a series I am tolerating. How mad is that anyway? It&rsquo;s like continuing to buy Stereolab or R.E.M. records long after you listened to any of them more than once.</p>
<p>So much happened in this and yet they managed to squeeze in far too much of Joel Mynor playing mind games and creepily justifying himself to Ballard. Oddly it was creepy Joel who actually hit home to me the utter wrongness of using the Dollhouse &ndash; using people for your gratification is immoral. The man is clearly not filling a void in his life if he has to repeat the event every year. I&rsquo;m not sure how much we were supposed to sympathize with Mynor. The ending seemed to endorse his use of the Dollhouse to make himself feel better.</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1633" title="dollhouse-16-echo-eliza dushku" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-16-echo.jpg" alt="dollhouse-16-echo-eliza dushku" width="479" height="289" /></strong></p>
<p>I loved Eliza Dushku&rsquo;s performance. She is really getting into her groove or is being better directed but her multiple characters were well played (her squeaky &ldquo;porn!&rdquo; as Boyd leads her out of the house was very funny).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1631" title="dollhouse-1.6-adelle-olivia-williams" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-16-adelle.jpg" alt="dollhouse-1.6-adelle-olivia-williams" width="444" height="266" /></p>
<p>Thank goodness that I am warming to Olivia Williams as Adelle at last. She was splendid telling Boyd she needed to give him a bonus and telling Lawrence that she played a bad hand well.</p>
<p>The fight between Ballard and Echo was superbly choreographed but it is ridiculous to think that any woman of Echo&rsquo;s stature (5&rsquo;5&rdquo;) could last twenty seconds against a man with the size, strength and skill of Ballard (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;) no matter how well programmed she is. His reach alone could hold her dangling helplessly from his outstretched arm. She ain&rsquo;t no Slayer.</p>
<p>The tv documentary vox pops seemed pointless filler even though they were clearly important enough for Joss Whedon to write them and to name the episode after them but then Ronald D. Moore thought flashbacks were needed in the finale of <em>BSG</em>. JW and RDM make (generally) great tv shows and I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I could have done with less of Tahmoh Penikett&rsquo;s hairless chest. Neither Eliza or Tahmoh being on display do anything for me but Miracle Laurie may be my new crush now that Katee Sackhoff is off to the other side.</p>
<p>Mellie underwent a drastic character change to start this episode as a believable human being. I do, however, feel a bit pissed off that she is a doll because I really liked her. She was warm, funny and real&hellip; I hadn&rsquo;t really noticed how gorgeous she was until this episode and she played off well with Tahmoh (particularly in their post-coital conversation &ldquo;I was thinking of Caroline.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;) and I even liked him too. It truly was a great episode ;-)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1632" title="dollhouse-1.6-mellie-miracle-laurie" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-16-mellie.jpg" alt="dollhouse-1.6-mellie-miracle-laurie" width="521" height="265" /></p>
<p>I absolutely and totally knew that she wasn&rsquo;t going to die. I didn&rsquo;t know how she was going to stay alive (the activation of her killer instinct was cool but not a surprise &ndash; she was far too bland and stupid NOT to be a doll) but I knew that there was no way that she was going to another Jenny Calendar.</p>
<p>I wish somebody would wipe my mind of the first four episodes.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men </em>- "The Benefactor"</strong></p>
<p>Oh dear, that was hard work. Don Draper is a bastard. I didn't like him at all at any time in this episode. His use of sexual violence was horrible no matter how horrible she was and I'm dismayed that some commentators think it was actually hot. It was also implausible. Where were they? It was a public place where anybody at any time could have interrupted them. Ach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1627" title="mad-men-s02s03-harry-crane" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/mad-men-s02s03.jpg" alt="mad-men-s02s03-harry-crane" width="454" height="259" /></p>
<p>I like Harry's story. I liked that he opened Ken's wage slip. I liked his understanding of how to use tv programmes to advertise to certain groups. I liked his relationship with his wife. I liked that they have worked through his infidelity and have moved on. I liked his inability to drive a hard bargain but still came out a winner. I liked his scene with Sal. I liked Harry's story.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I DISLIKED everything else except Betty's response to the accusation that she was profoundly sad.</p>

I'm not arguing she didn't deserve to be punished but by Galen "Chief" Tyrol? Tigh's snarky comment to Chief afterwards that nobody cared about her didn't help matters.</p>
<p>Other remarks: the flashback scene when Boomer is chastised by Adama and Tigh who were both drunk was repulsive. They were laughing and sneering at her and I don't understand why the scene was written like that. It was horrible.</p>
<p>The finale was good enough considering the poverty of what we had been served up ever since they found "Earth" although it was rather endless once they reached the real Earth. There are huge problems with the finale but I'm not that bothered by the implausibilities and impracticalities. The show went downhill from the moment they left D'Anna on "Earth" (the awesome Lucy Lawless was not able to appear in any more episodes) and that affected the plot.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> but I'm glad it's finished.</p>
