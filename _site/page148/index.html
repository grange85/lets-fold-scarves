                  <p><strong>Superstar</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>I enjoyed this episode a lot except for the last leaden minutes but I haven't much to say about it.</p>
<p>Jonathan says watch out for southpaws but this may have been the proof the Scoobies needed: he isn&rsquo;t one. And he may not know how to deal with his own inadequacies but he does give Buffy and Riley sound advice.</p>

<p>The scenes with Anya being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anya_Jenkins#Is_Anya_a_metaphor_for_autism.3F">metaphor-for-autism</a> are classic: "Oh you're still here. That's nice." and later: "Stop with the shrimp I am trying to do something here!"</p>

                  <p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>This is probably my favourite ever episode of <em>BtVS</em> but it isn&rsquo;t entirely perfect: the actors who play the three Watchers&rsquo; Council men may or may not be British but they sure sound awful and it&rsquo;s distracting. Plus Adam&hellip;and the spit that runs down Buffy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>As I write these reviews (notes?) I surf around the Internet for various reasons (in this case to find out the preferred terms for Faith and Buffy which I decided not to bother with) and I come across other websites and blogs that cover the same ground. I am constantly struck by the near hatred that <em>BtVS</em> can provoke. Some people are so angry, proprietorial, and demanding; it&rsquo;s as if they believe the series and its creators <em>personally</em> owe them something. Season four and six are the targets of the most venom and I wonder why they bother with something that they dislike so much. Then I wonder if my gripes could be conceived the same way so in order to make it clear: I love <em>BtVS</em> and even the problems I have with season six don&rsquo;t stop the love I have for it and all that came before it. Maybe any hatred I may have is reserved for season seven but I even though I have never seen an episode from that season again I still remember liking a lot of it. I have noticed a bit of the above coming out in reviews of the season eight comics with folk demanding less Andrew, who Amy&rsquo;s boyfriend&rsquo;s should be, etc, as if Joss and co should or could please everyone.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of reasons why it&rsquo;s a favourite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah Michelle Gellar is outstanding as Faith in Buffy&rsquo;s body. Eliza Dushku doesn&rsquo;t come close though she tries hard.</li>
<li>Faith takes a bath and practises &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am, you know.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yours&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;On her way to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.&rdquo; &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; &ldquo; Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested&hellip;I guess that's just regular justice.&rdquo;<br />
</li></p>
<li>Faith stabs Willow and I get all shivery when she stabs Willow where Buffy stabbed Faith.<br />
</li></p>
<li>
&ldquo;Well, I'm glad you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone.&rdquo; I love the snark between Anya and Giles.<br />
</li></p>
<li>&ldquo;You know why I really hate you, Summers?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, yeah, that covers a lot of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cause I could do anything I want, and instead, I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you popped like warm Champagne and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't? Because it's wrong.&rdquo; This scene is just incredible: just one more example of &ldquo;how did they get away with that?&rdquo;<br />
</li><br />

<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image491" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/who-are-you-wrong.jpg" alt="Who Are You - because it's wrong" /></div><br /></p>
<li>
&ldquo;So Willow's not driving stick anymore.&rdquo; Heh, in two minutes Faith sees more than the Scoobies.</li></p>
<p><br />
<div style="text-align:center;"><br /><img id="image492" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/who-are-you-stick.jpg" alt="Who Are You - not driving stick" /></div><br /></p>
<li>Faith walks after the vampire and I just love the swishing sound as she picks up the pool cue.</li>
<li>Faith is conflicted as the woman she has saved says thank you but surely Faith has heard gratitude before?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.&rdquo; Meow.</li>
<li>&ldquo;She's not your friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;I may have overestimated the "you liking her" factor.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no. I mean, I don't...I don't think she's...her.&rdquo; &ldquo;You lost me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, a person's energy has a flow, a unity. Buffy's was fragmented. It-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. Plus, she was, um, she was kind of mean.&rdquo; In two minutes, Tara sees more than the Scoobies.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I-I think there's a way we can, hmm...The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it'll help her. What?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is...It-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane. &ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo; &ldquo;It-it's not like anything that we've ever&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Riley, Riley, Riley, make a note of this: if your girlfriend comes on to you in a weird and out-there manner and she has never behaved like that before. Ask yourself is she all right? Is her mind where it should be? Is she herself?</li>
<li>Okay, the Nether Realms ritual is just a spell. Oh all right, it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a metaphor for sex. So magic = sex not magic = addiction, right? Anyway, it&rsquo;s an outrageous scene that is in truth rather explicit because in most love scenes on TV we don&rsquo;t usually see a participant actually have a (flaming) o.
<p><br /></li>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image493" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/who-are-you-o.jpg" alt="Who Are You - flaming o" /></div><br /></p>
<li>Faith is in turmoil after having sex with Riley. What are we to think? Is she amazed by his tenderness? By his profession of love? By how much she enjoyed it? Was her mind invaded by Willow?</li>
<li>&ldquo;Yeah, you're a killer.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not a killer! I am the Slayer! And you don't know the first thing about me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Who's president?&rdquo; &ldquo;We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.&rdquo; &hellip;&ldquo;Giles, you turned into a demon and I knew it was you! I mean, can't you just look in my eyes and be all &hellip; intuitive?&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;How did I turn into a demon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! Cause, uh, Ethan Rayne. And-and you have a girlfriend named Olivia. And you haven't had a job since we blew up the school&hellip;which is valid, lifestyle wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but &hellip; Oh, oh! When I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a stevedore during sex. Do you want me to continue?&rdquo; &ldquo;Actually, I beg you to stop.&rdquo; &ldquo;What's a stevedore?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Riley was on his way to church.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Damn it, man! We have to get inside! Our, uh, uh, families are-are in there! Our, uh, m-mothers and-and tiny, tiny babies!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You're nothing! Disgusting! Murderous bitch! You're nothing! You're disgusting!&rdquo; I feel it&rsquo;s a shame that <em>Five by Five</em> and <em>Sanctuary</em> were basically rehashes of <em>This Year&rsquo;s Girl</em> and <em>Who Are You?</em> because I was looking forward to much more than we did get.</li><br />

                  <p><strong>This Year's Girl</strong> (Douglas Petrie)<br />
<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image487" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/s-girl-xander-almost-fried.jpg" alt="This Year's Girl - Xander almost fried" /></div></p>
<p>Xander almost fries himself and no one notices and I don&rsquo;t think it is stretching to say that this reflects the minds of the <em>BtVS</em> creators who didn&rsquo;t have a clue what to do with the character who didn&rsquo;t go to college (not that Buffy, Willow or Riley seem to have done much work recently) and Riley fixing it so easily is just another sign of contempt for a character who, although I have a lot of problems with, deserved better than this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo; &ldquo;The truth? That she's my wacky identical cousin from England, and whenever she visits hi-jinks ensue?&rdquo; &ldquo;It's good you guys have such an honest relationship.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I told him the story. I vagued up a few bits, but no flat-out lies.&rdquo; Sigh, this so sums up <em>BtVS</em>.</p>
<p>I love the conversation between Willow and Tara about Faith, that is, I love it when I focus on the words and not the clothes. They are not the worst outfit either wear (see Willow's <em>After Life</em>'s "You're welcome" red top and Tara's "that's my cue to put some clothes on" but-please-not-that-Sam-Browne-belt-blouse in <em>Seeing Red</em>) but it&rsquo;s the worst duo of outfits. The insane costumer must have said something like this: "Amber dear, you are actually slim but you have a big bottom so, wear this sash to diminish your breasts and make your hips look vast. Oh, and Aly, here's a tablecloth that'll look super" (...on a table).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strictly recon. What?&rdquo; &ldquo;You said "recon". You're like Cool Monster Fighter!&rdquo;...&ldquo;Don't worry, we're sure to spot Faith first. She's like this cleavagey slut-bomb walking around "Ooh, check me out, I'm wicked-cool, I'm five-by-five."&rdquo; &ldquo;Five-by-five? Five what by five what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith vs Joyce: Faith nails the distance between Buffy and Joyce (not seen since <em>Fear, Itself</em>) but Joyce shows a bit of pep: "Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?"<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image488" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/tyg1.jpg" alt="This Year's Girl - Buffy and Faith" /></div><br />
Buffy coming through the window is silly but a brilliant touch. Cue another great fight (despite the stunt doubles there is something elemental about seeing these two evenly matched people (women) bashing the heck out of each other). I'd love to try my hand at analysing their relationship and the similarities and differences between them but I know someone with more time and talent than me has already done it.</p>
<p>The final twist ("five by five") is proper cliffhanger material.</p>

                  <p><strong>Goodbye Iowa</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>Riley is confused and is going cold turkey: all he understood has been ripped up and scattered: he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Michty me, Adam was dull wasn&rsquo;t he? I do believe I may have elided him from my memory along with season five&rsquo;s knights.</p>
<p>Emma Caulfield is a joy to listen to:  Buffy; &ldquo;Maggie tried to kill me.&rdquo; Anya: &ldquo;It didn't work but they're all upset anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene in the basement as morning comes is classic ensemble BtVS:  the Wile E. Coyote comments (&ldquo;That would never happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, no Buff. That's why they call them cartoons, not documentaries.&rdquo;), Giles and Anya bitching (&ldquo;Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.&rdquo; <img id="image486" src="/images/uploads/2007/04/goodbye-iowa-three-in-a-bed.jpg" class="left" alt="Goodbye Iowa - three in a bed - Willow, Anya and Buffy" />&ldquo;Every time you moved it made squeaky noises. It was irritating.&rdquo; &ldquo;Really? I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.&rdquo;), Anya&rsquo;s possessiveness over Xander and Buffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;yummy sushi pajamas" speech.</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s bandana: why?
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image484" src="/images/uploads/2007/04/s-bandana.jpg" alt="Goodbye Iowa - Buffy's bandanna" /></div></p>
<p>Andy was chortling over this: &ldquo;No, you don't have to explain. I don't mind, really. I've been thinking about that last spell we did...all day.&rdquo; Chortling: like Xander in <em>Restless</em>.</p>
<p>Xander&rsquo;s military experience sure was handier than Buffy&rsquo;s helpless lady but the scriptwriters via Anya at least make us realise it&rsquo;s a smidgeon silly: &ldquo;He's the only one with military experience.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's not like he was in the 'Nam. He was G.I. Joe for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tara does a daft and dangerous thing but I&rsquo;ll discuss that and the second daft thing she does when I get to <em>Family</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the jokes are tasteless (and not very plausible, Xander the guy who reads comics wouldn&rsquo;t know retinal?): &ldquo;Sorry. I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.&rdquo; &ldquo;The&hellip; ewww. I don't want to see that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Retinal scan, Xander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why she was wearing that bandana so Riley can wrap the grubby thing around his wounded hand in a military hospital.</p>

I&rsquo;ve decided to change the name of my <em>How am I different</em> category to <em>Female thinking</em> because it&rsquo;s a more accurate reflection of the contents. I don&rsquo;t really know what the Aimee Mann song is about, plus, "Female thinking" is ironic because it&rsquo;s what Bill Hickok says to Calamity Jane when she&rsquo;s mooning over some stuffed shirt (the worst thing about <em>CJ</em> is the wooden (stuffed and wooden?) Philip Carey). I have loved and enjoyed <em>Calamity Jane</em> for many years but only recently has my attention been drawn to the entirely lesbian interpretation that can be brought to it. <em>A Woman&rsquo;s Touch</em> indeed.<br /></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image483" src="/images/uploads/2007/04/seven-brides.jpg" alt="Seven Brides for Seven Brothers - poster with all the women slung over the men's shoulders" /></div><br />
Howard Keel who made me swoon as Clayton Farlow in <em>Dallas</em> (I know, I know, but old Sean Connery is a handsome devil too) has been in three films with exceedingly questionable sexist attitudes : <em>Calamity Jane</em>, <em>Kiss Me Kate</em> and <em>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> (I reckon the latter set the ball rolling for feminism) but I forgive him because of that rumbling baritone and those tights in <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>.

I must mention a couple of blogs that have caught my attention. The first I came across today which is the wonderful riposte to the vile and abominable <em>Observer Woman</em> monthly magazine which is an insult to women everywhere. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://spittingmadwoman.blogspot.com/">Observer Woman Makes Me Spit</a> which says it all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have to love anybody&rsquo;s blog whose About Me says &ldquo;I'm a misanthropic humanist. While I'm a do-gooder by training and profession, I sort of also loathe people.&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s more! The very funny Suzanne Reisman is the founder of <a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/">CUSS</a> which is not the most attractive of acronyms but I'm a CUSS supporter. As she says "<a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/2005/10/why-world-needs-pubic-hair.html">Feline pussies with fur are nice to stroke. Hairless cats are freaky.</a>" She also wrote this very good article on being <a href="http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/entry/I_will_never_be_a_Mrs_husband/5279.html">Mrs. Husband</a>: "It is strange to me that a woman would invest so much time in her education and work life, building a reputation and accruing respect for her achievements under one identity, and then suddenly become (sort of) someone else."</p>
