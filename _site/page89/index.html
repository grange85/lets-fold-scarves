                  <p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2424" title="Storyteller - Buffy" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/Storyteller-Buffy.jpg" alt="Storyteller - Buffy" width="534" height="300" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Storyteller</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>Andrew, Andrew, Andrew...</p>
<p>This was better than I remembered because I am more sympathetic towards Andrew and I am not spending my time being annoyed that it focused on him. It's quite an achievement to make you care about a mainly irritating character but this worked for me and Tom Lenk's performance helped too. Jane Espenson pulled off a similar feat in "I Was Made to Love You" and we only knew April for one episode.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2422" title="Storyteller - Buffy and Andrew" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/Storyteller-Buffy-and-Andrew.jpg" alt="Storyteller - Buffy and Andrew" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>However, it is far from great. The scene at the beginning when Andrew expositioned unnecessarily about the Hellmouth, the seal, the First and the Bringers felt like it was half an hour long. Jane, we know and it's S7 and you aren't going to get new viewers now. Dawn should have been in the scene when they discuss the knife. She's the Slayer's sister and she, completely out of nowhere, knows all about ancient languages.</p>
<p>Spike's bad boy act was nothing compared with his posing in "Restless". I was jolly disappointed that Robin missed his chance to off him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2421" title="Storyteller - Andrew, Willow, Kennedy" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/Storyteller-Andrew-Willow-Kennedy.jpg" alt="Storyteller - Andrew, Willow, Kennedy" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I wonder if we are supposed to be persuaded that Andrew is gay when he ignores two women making out to take a close look at Xander's handiwork. If Willow and Kennedy looked like they were really into each other then that might have worked. I am more convinced that's he's gay because he was completely swept up in the Xander and Anya reconciliation. He's watched that scene so many times. (I must clarify that I don't believe that all gay men love a melodrama but it is a handy trope.)</p>
<p>I was uninterested in Xander and Anya's reconciliation. I never I really bought into them as a couple despite their years together. He was often patronising and condescending towards her. Unfortunately, the show now doesn't know what to do with her unless Giles is around.</p>
<p>Ah well, we are wading to the end.</p>

                <article>
                  
                  <p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2412" title="Mad Men S03E07 - Betty" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/Mad-Men-S03E07.jpg" alt="Mad Men S03E07 - Betty" width="443" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Seven Twenty Three" </strong>(<strong> </strong>Andre Jacquemetton &amp; Maria Jacquemetton and Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p>Another excellent episode. I am pleased that this show is picking up mid-season and I am doubly pleased to see some Betty scenes in S3 that I actually enjoyed.</p>
<p>I was oddly elated during her scenes involving Henry Francis. I know what she is doing and if she was married to a faithful husband then I would be mortified but she's married to Don who was at his most hateful throughout this episode.</p>
<p>Betty highlights include being bashful about the effect of her looks (I love Francine: "It's not adorable to pretend like you're not adorable"), her interactions with the children ("freeze!"), trying the drawer in Don's study, the chat with Henry in the cafe, her dismissal of Roger, and her confrontation with Don ("It&rsquo;s three years, Don! What&rsquo;s the matter, you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going to be in three years?" and "You're right. Why would I think that has anything to do with me?").</p>
<p>I have suddenly acknowledged that January Jones sometimes gives weakish performances and I wonder if Betty's iciness is not just her character but JJ's rather frozen acting style.</p>
<p>Peggy makes terrible decisions at times. I'm not at all prepared to guess how her decision to sleep with Duck will pan out but I do hope she doesn't end up working for him.</p>
<p>In another odd turn of events, I thought the scene in the morning when they began having sex again was erotic (sorry). Even so, Duck's seduction technique made me laugh quite hard.</p>
<p>Peggy is young, she's had a Catholic upbringing, she has no friends, she has nowhere to turn for advice,<em> New Cosmopolitan </em>hasn't been launched yet, no wonder she makes mistakes.</p>
<p>A mistake she shouldn't have made was to go into Don's office after Roger had just left. Boy, was Don hard on her! Not all unjustified but harsh. Elisabeth Moss was awesome here.</p>
<p>Across the usual blogs there were many complains about Peggy being a Norwegian Catholic (as if it was impossible not just improbable) and yet Conrad Hilton was a Catholic Norwegian. I loved Don's response to him when he was critical of his office d&eacute;cor: "Maybe I&rsquo;m not on time because I was with my family reading the Bible.&rdquo; Hilton was in Don's chair as were Betty and Cooper.</p>
<p>How much do I enjoy Pete and Peggy together? They bicker beautifully.</p>
<p>Don is quite spectacularly nasty and it was hard to feel sorry for him when he was felled by the male hitch-hiker. I thought those scenes were the weakest part of the episode. Though I thought the grammatical error in the hitch-hikers' note was a delicious touch (I sincerely hope it was deliberate).</p>
<p>Don is not the reason why I watch<em> Mad Men</em>. He's very important but he's not why I watch it with relish.</p>

                <article>
                  
                  <p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2402" title="Dollhouse - Instinct - Miracle Laurie - grey eyes" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/mywindow04.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Instinct - Miracle Laurie - grey eyes" width="432" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Instinct"</strong> (Michele Fazekas &amp; Tara Butters)</p>
<p>This has to be one of the daftest premises for an episode of anything. Just how long was Echo going to be Jack's mother? Until his father had got over his wife's death? And then how long was Jack going to take to get over his mummy's disappearance? Furthermore, how could Mr Jordan afford two dolls?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unbelievable thing in the episode is that the police believed her.</p>
<p>And Topher ain't that much of a genius. Apparently, hormones and massaging can induce breast milk in women who have not been mothers. And based on my own <em>instinct</em>, I say nonsense to anything called a maternal instinct and, particularly, on the notion that it overrides anything else. Eliza was once again good though.</p>
<p>I adore Olivia Williams. She is the <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/cast/pcampbell">Pete</a>* of this show. Her character can do anything and I still love her. I loved the scene between her and (as we need to refer to her now) Madeline where she made me laugh just by swigging tea.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2401" title="Dollhouse - Instinct - Olivia Williams as Adelle drinking tea" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/mywindow05.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Instinct - Olivia Williams as Adelle drinking tea" width="427" height="300" /></p>
<p>It was lovely to see Miracle Laurie who looked absolutely magnificent. Madeline may not be sad any more but there is definitely something missing: she felt a little flat, almost soulless.</p>
<p>Accents are funny things: Sierra sounded authentically American to me while Alexei Denisof sounded fake.</p>
<p>And is this the first episode in which Echo doesn't get hit?</p>
<p>*yikes, I spoke too soon...</p>

<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Vows"</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>Thirteen things:</p>
<p>One, Olivia Williams' hair is not "ugly", does not "look awful", and does "flatter her". Seriously, did these complainers see the dos she had in S1?</p>
<p>Two, the A story (I assume the story with Echo is the A story) was ill-conceived and poorly executed. Think about any of it for more than ten seconds and it turns into Emmental cheese. It was terrible. And it consumed a large chunk of the episode. And I could moan about all of it.</p>
<p>Three, I am happy to report that Eliza Dushku rocked her different roles. This is the first time that I have felt she was on top of them all.</p>
<p>Four, conversely, Dichen Lachman was found out: she can't do posh (which is weird - everyone can do posh) and that two minutes of an Anglo-Asian in pink was excruciating and unfunny.</p>
<p>Five, Adelle fingering Victor's scars was still not enough Victor.</p>
<p>Six, Olivia Williams was in tremendous form. She really relishes her role as Adelle. Andy thought she looked a bit thin. I didn't really notice. However, I will be mightily disappointed if her face ever loses its mobility and its lines.</p>
<p>Seven, freaky accent changes from Jamie Bamber and Alexis Denisof.</p>
<p>Eight, Tahmoh Penikett sets me on edge. He walks funny, he stands funny, he speaks funny. And the character he plays doesn't interest me.</p>
<p>Nine, Ballard's push ups were just so cringeworthy and unworthy. Cheap.</p>
<p>Ten, talking of cheap: I hadn't really grasped what was going on in the scene between Whiskey and Echo until I rewatched it and, eek, that was tacky. She's having her vagina checked out (with hands of blue) and she has a sexy flashback. Urgh.</p>
<p>Eleven, I was dismayed at Ballard hitting Echo in order to get her to drop into ninja mode. Dismayed that this sort of violence is barely commented upon. Dismayed also because it's a crappy device. Dismayed because it is totally unrealistic. Yes, I know this is fantasy but things have to make sense within the reality of the fantasy. One slap from a man built like Ballard would put little Echo in a seriously bad place. And bored of it too. How many times is Echo going get hit? Every.single.episode?</p>
<p>Twelve, I don't understand quite why Whiskey attempted to have sex (or not) with Topher. This lack of comprehension I accept may be my fault. However, Amy Acker slumped against a wall saying "because I don't wanna die" was the best part of the show.</p>
<p>Thirteen, as it ended,&nbsp; I turned to Andy and said "I don't know if I can be arsed watching this anymore". A rather pointless statement because I will continue to watch it. Damn you Joss, if this was made by anybody else, I would have said goodbye a long time ago (see <em>Alias</em>, <em>Lost</em>, <em>Heroes</em>, <em>The X-Files</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>).</p>

                  <p><strong>Get It Done</strong> (Douglas Petrie)</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2381" title="Get It Done - Robin, Buffy and Kennedy" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Get-It-Done-Robin-Buffy-and-Kennedy.jpg" alt="Get It Done - Robin, Buffy and Kennedy" width="534" height="300" /></strong></p>
<p>Okay, Kennedy has started to really annoy me. Though not as much as the "what the hell was that?" speech from Buffy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone want to say a few words about Chloe? Let me. Chloe    was an idiot. Chloe was stupid. She was weak. And anyone in a rush to be the    next dead body I bury, it's easy. Just, think of Chloe, and do what she did.    And I'll find room for you next to her and Annabelle. I'm the Slayer. The one    with the power. And the First has me using that power to dig our graves. I've been carrying you. All of you. Too far, too long.    Ride's over.</blockquote><br />
It may <em>seem</em> interminable but really it's not been <em>that</em> long. Plus, poor Chloe, yes, she got done by the First but I do believe that Spike was also a victim...speaking of Spike, I truly find him an objectionable character. "Nancy" as a term of abuse? Not nice.</p>
<p>"We've got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a Wicca who won't-a, and the    brains of our operation wears oven mitts." Funny, but surely the brains belong to Giles?</p>

<p>Ha, over at TWoP: "<a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/buffy_the_vampire_slayer/get_it_done.php?page=13">Every time Willow does a locator spell, a little part of me dies</a>."</p>
<p>There was a lovely cute Dawn moment when she teases Buffy.</p>
<p>All the potentials are sent up stairs but when Spike is thrown through the ceiling he lands in an empty room. What a wasted opportunity because Spike scattering potentials would have been funny.</p>
<p>The shadowcasters scene was nifty.</p>
<p>Erm.</p>
