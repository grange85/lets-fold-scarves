<p>Apparently Terence Stamp turned down the role of Montag because he thought he would be overshadowed by Julie Christie. Well, to this set of eyes and ears he needn't have worried. I am at a loss to understand the attraction of Julie Christie. She doesn't seem either talented or compelling or even that good looking.</p>
<p>Andy and I started thinking about who was good-looking in the sixties and seventies and we had a problem thinking of anybody. I suggested that Terence Stamp himself was beautiful and maybe that was the problem - the era was full of beautiful men like Stamp, Hemmings, Beatty and McDowell. The women couldn't get a look in.</p>
<p><em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is almost a great film but it suffers from its limited locations (making it look like a TV programme), its disconnected continuity, its lacklustre lead and from any sense of urgency. It failed to make Montag's wife at all interesting when I think in the book she was clearly depressed and repressed and not simply shallow.</p>

<p>I did like the locations they did find especially the <a href="http://ardfilmjournal.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/future-worlds-the-familiar-as-future-in-fahrenheit-451/">Alton Estate </a>and the <a href="http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/History2.html">SAFEGE Monorail</a>.</p>

<p>The most powerful sequences were in the old woman's house with the increasing tension between the Captain and Montag and the old woman's suicide along with her murdered books.</p>
<p>The spoken opening titles were fabulous and Bernard Hermann was the Danny Elfman of his day: instantly recognisable.</p>

                  <p>I was just writing another blog post while listening to a free CD that came with Word magazine and the sweet vocals of Ben Taylor (son of Carly Simon and James Taylor (and you can tell)) came to my attention as he sang "Wicked Way":</p>
<blockquote><p>I just want to take you out and get you drunk so I can have my wicked way with you<br />
I'm just being honest cause I know the other guys are thinking just the same way too<br />
And I'm not gonna lie and say that I will take you out to dance there's just no chance cause I don't even like the same music you do<br />
I just wanna have my wicked way with you<br />
So don't you fight it cause I know you're gonna like it<br />
Show me some skin I might bite it<br />
I wanna have my wicked way with you</blockquote></p>
<p>Thanks Ben for a song that is obviously amusing and sweet and not at all offensive.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Haunted"</strong> (Jane Espenson &amp; Maurissa Tacharoen &amp; Jed Whedon)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1796" title="Dollhouse - Haunted - Echo acting just like a middle-aged woman" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dh-110-echo.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Haunted - Echo acting just like a middle-aged woman" width="467" height="300" /></p>
<p>Eliza Dushku has a limited range has an actor (that&rsquo;s okay, so did Doris Day) and that was quite evident in &ldquo;Haunted&rdquo;. <em>Dollhouse</em> isn&rsquo;t a vehicle that suits ED but I am struggling to see what actor could manage it.</p>
<p>This episode was the <em>Dollhouse</em> meets Miss Marple. Jane Marple was always being parachuted into people&rsquo;s homes to undercover a possible crime. I missed the part when Echo was invaded to stay in the dead woman&rsquo;s bedroom. Rich people with large houses often find they have to accommodate strangers this way even with wills of introduction.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1794" align="aligncenter" width="496" caption="Oi, you two, be quiet"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1794" title="Dollhouse - Haunted - Adelle and Echo at the funeral" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dh-110-adelle-and-echo.jpg" alt="Oi, you two, be quiet" width="496" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The funeral service scene was awful. I fully expected the other mourners to turn round en mass and tell these people to stop being so bloody rude and shut up.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the Topher and his best friend who is just like him for one scene but otherwise I find Fran Kranz hard to watch for more than a few seconds.</p>
<p>The problem with MOTW eps like this is the challenge to get you to care about the characters in the &ldquo;mission&rdquo; storyline who you are never going to see again. Neglected daughters, loser sons, and young husbands &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to care about such cardboard characters. <em>Dead Like Me</em> did MOTW (where the M stands for mortality (noun)) episodes much better &ndash; the gay couple episode called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.tv.com/Dead+Like+Me/The+Bicycle+Thief/episode/257369/summary.html">The Bicycle Thief</a>&rdquo; was deeply moving.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1795" title="Dollhouse - Haunted - Paul looking freaking scary" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/dh-110-paul.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Haunted - Paul looking freaking scary" width="424" height="358" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted&rdquo; was redeemed for me by the compelling Paul/Mellie storyline which was full of disturbing and revelatory things:</p>
<ul>
<li> November&rsquo;s criminal record</li>
<li>her programming as a passive doormat</li>
<li>rough sex</li>
<li>"I found one"</li>
<li>Ballard wants to rescue Caroline but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be inclined to want to rescue Mellie. He&rsquo;s using a woman who is right in front of him who is tangible and real (but not quite herself at the moment) in favour of someone who he has formed a picture of, a someone who is NOT there, someone like Laura in the film <em>Laura</em>.</li><br />
</ul><br />
[If you want a more considered analysis of <em>Dollhouse</em>, then Charles over at <a href="http://heartachewithhardwork.blogspot.com/2009/04/you-make-people-different-you-can-make.html">Heartache with Hard Work</a> is doing a great job.]</p>
<p>Miracle Laurie seems to be the Amber Benson of <em>Dollhouse</em> &ndash; in lots of episodes but not in the opening credits.</p>
<p>Somebody in the costuming department has a stiletto heel fetish.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Gold Violin" </strong>(<a href="http://www.film.com/celebrities/jane-anderson/biography/14644824">Jane Anderson</a> and Andre Jacquemetton &amp; Maria Jacquemetton)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1782" title="Mad Men - The Gold Violin Sal Kitty Ken" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/mad-men-17.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The Gold Violin Sal Kitty Ken" width="426" height="300" /></p>
<p>The Don flashback was intriguing and tantalizing.</p>
<p>Has Joan met her match? Jane won that bout but there&rsquo;ll be sticky times ahead.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned before how much I detest Roger? He is so creepy and always looks as though he is going to make a pass at any woman.</p>
<p>Sal&rsquo;s behaviour at dinner toward Ken was a little OTT. And would Ken not have missed his lighter quite quickly and guessed where he had left it?</p>
<p>I loved Sal&rsquo;s wife, Kitty. She was instantly likable in a way that I can&rsquo;t think that any other character has been (except, maybe, Rachel). I wish Ken behaved as nicely as he did in this and &ldquo;The Wheel&rdquo; because generally I find him rather sinister.</p>
<p>God, not more of the Barretts I thought when Jimmy phoned Betty. However, I am willing to put up with more of &ldquo;you people&rdquo; if it leads to an awesome Don <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smackdown">smackdown</a>. The silence in the car journey home would have been a brilliant way to the end the episode (like "<a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/04/15/you-know-i-do-&hellip;ng-lemon-bundtyou-know-i-do-an-empowering-lemon-bundt/">Hush</a>") but Betty vomiting was perfection (and I can&rsquo;t stand vomiting scenes usually).</p>
<p>Obviously people littered in the sixties but would people like the Drapers be such bad citizens? It seemed a rather clunky way to make a comparison between a lack of concern for their surroundings versus a desire for a pristine car interior.</p>
<p>There quite a lot of Betty hate on the TWoP boards &ndash; TWoP is the only place guaranteed to be spoiler free in <a href="http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=3176855">episode</a> discussions &ndash; which I am puzzled about. [I also don&rsquo;t like the new use of the word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;criticism&rdquo;.] Some of the criticism centres on Betty&rsquo;s alleged shallowness that I do appreciate is a valid concern but in general the complaints are about Betty being a bad mother. First, I dispute that she is a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mother. She may not dote on her children but seems attentive and engaged enough, e.g., she doesn&rsquo;t have to sit down and eat with them. Secondly, why should she dote on her children? Children she had because that was expected of women in her position. A modern Betty, a woman in her late twenties, has the real choice of not having children if she doesn&rsquo;t want to have them. The criticism is also gendered. She gets called on her parenting while Don gets a pass. She may not have finished her game of chequers with Sally but at least she was playing with her daughter unlike Don. I also see that people can look for reasons to see her as bad mother. When Jimmy phones her, she shoos Sally out of the kitchen and that was seen as bad by a couple of posters. I can&rsquo;t say that not wanting a potentially noisy child near you when you are on the phone is a symptom of poor parenting!</p>
<p>This is the first episode in a while that has gone me itching to see the next one as soon as possible.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Deep Down"</strong> (Steven S. DeKnight)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" title="deep-down-angel" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-angel.jpg" alt="deep-down-angel" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of <em>Angel</em> but I am a completist* and I've started so I'll finish and so we are watching S4 to accompany <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> S7.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have decided to blog <em>Angel</em> from now on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1769" title="deep-down-lorne" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-lorne.jpg" alt="deep-down-lorne" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I am watching S4 with low expectations so it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed this. It was really sad to see Andy Hallett resplendent in his greenery because it is terrible that he has died so ridiculously young. He also played one of my favourite characters. Cordy is also one of my favourites so it was disappointing to see so little of her (though storywise it made sense).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1768" title="deep-down-cordy" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-cordy.jpg" alt="deep-down-cordy" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>Fred and Gunn are a tiresome couple. The Fluffy dialogue started off being amusing but degenerated into tastelessness and unfunniness. It was painful.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1772" align="aligncenter" width="534" caption="Taking a Fluffy joke a little too far"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1772" title="deep-down-fred" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-fred.jpg" alt="Taking a Fluffy joke a little too far" width="534" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The sex scene between Wes and Lilah was notable for Alexis Denisof's chest, for Wesley doing something weird with his tongue and for Lilah licking his neck. The latter two things I wish I could forget.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1771" title="deep-down-lilah" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-lilah.jpg" alt="deep-down-lilah" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>Stephanie Romanov looked rather lovely and her character has indisputably moved to the right of the dark side with her beheading of Linwood. Linwood had a point, mind you, about her shortcomings, she is generally useless particularly if she did think Wesley didn't know anything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1767" title="deep-down-connor" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-connor.jpg" alt="deep-down-connor" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I like Vincent Kartheiser as Connor. I like the actor so much in <em>Mad Men</em> that I may be predisposed to like Connor but then I do like Dawn too.</p>
<p>Angel's chat with Connor asking him what he deserved (a second chance, clearly) worked quite well considering the whole champion thing and using the comparison of what Buffy did to him (for more noble reasons, it must be said!) was excellent.</p>
<p>Since everything I write about seems to come back to <em>Dollhouse</em>, here is another observation. My problem with <em>DH</em> is that if you are going to deal with "difficult" subjects like prostitution, trafficking,&nbsp; etc, then you need to deal with it well. Dealing with it crappily isn't acceptable. So if <em>Angel</em> isn't that great, it really doesn't matter because it doesn't usually deal with difficult real-life issues. Which is why "Billy" is one of my least favourite episodes along with "I Fall to Pieces" (stalking), "Hero" (Nazis) and "Expecting" (forced surrogate pregnancy).</p>
<p>*I'll probably one day finish <em>Astonishing X-Men</em> and I won't stop watching <em>Dollhouse</em> if it's renewed just like I didn't stop watching <em>Heroes</em> at the end of S2. I have stopped now. The murder of Elle was the final straw for a show that has next to no idea of how to write female characters of any interest at all.</p>
