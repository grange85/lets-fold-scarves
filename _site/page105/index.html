                  <p><strong>Normal Again</strong> (Diego Gutierrez)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" title="normal-again-buffy" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/normal-again-buffy.jpg" alt="normal-again-buffy" width="535" height="300" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Quote of the season: &ldquo;You're addicted to the misery.&rdquo;</strong></p></p>
<p>I looked back at a review from season 5 and, while the episode wasn&rsquo;t very good (it was &ldquo;Spiral&rdquo;), I wrote about it with affection. I don&rsquo;t feel affectionate towards the mid to latter half of season 6, a fact which I am inclined to blame on my wavering attachment to Joss Whedon.</p>
<p>Whedon seems to bring out the critic in a lot of us. I think the weight of his self-proclaimed feminism and his desire to explore contentious issues is becoming too much for his work to bear. After all, I can happily watch series like <em>Bionic Woman</em> and <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em> and not really care how contrived or inconsistent or stupid they are as long as they reasonably entertain me but I can't do that with Whedon's work because there is supposed to be more to it than mere entertainment.</p>
<p>For me, the problem with season 6 has been its sexual content and unpleasant plotting revolving around Warren. Sexual exploitation and manipulation is part of human life but I don&rsquo;t want to watch it on TV. Which leads me to <em>Dollhouse</em> &ndash; I know the task that Whedon has set himself to do but do I want to watch how he is going about it?</p>
<p>I was initially reluctant to watch <em>Mad Men</em> because I thought that I didn&rsquo;t want to watch a show about misogyny and racism but the show is of such high quality that although it portrays these things it does so in an interesting, mostly subtle and definitely thought provoking way. It&rsquo;s not entirely light-handed but it is not ever a gratuitous show. I think my point is that <em>Mad Men</em> is well made but <em>Dollhouse</em> isn&rsquo;t &ndash; yet.</p>
<p><strong>Season 6 isn&rsquo;t very good overall.</strong></p>
<p>I have now tipped into <em>that</em> camp. Except for &ldquo;Once More, With Feeling&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tabula Rasa&rdquo;, the episodes have been a mixed bag that were too often unbearable particularly anything involving Spuffy and the Willow&rsquo;s a junkie storyline and not just because they are difficult topics but also because the writing and the plotting were weak. It has been a struggle to get through this boxed set, and the competition for my time, namely <em>Mad Men</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>(and that has its weaknesses and inconsistencies but is often exciting and moving), has highlighted the weaknesses of latter day <em>Buffy</em>.</p>
<p>I also blame Anthony Head. Giles&rsquo; absence has been keenly felt and not just for the Scooby gang. His mature, adult presence stuck the show together (and ensured less screen time for other characters).</p>
<p>On to a few points about the episode itself:</p>
<p>I think it was brave to suggest that Buffy may still be in a mental institution with the final scene in the hospital. It can and is argued that this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean she has always been there but it is borderline UNambiguous.</p>
<p>A line like &ldquo;Eventually my parents just forgot&rdquo; is really not enough to erase Joyce&rsquo;s reaction to Buffy&rsquo;s coming out all the way back in season 2. However, if it's all in her head then anything can happen on 7 seasons of Buffy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t really care one way or the other but I hadn&rsquo;t realised until I read <a href="http://www.superjer.com/buffy/6x17_normal_again.php">Sam</a>&rsquo;s comments on <a href="http://www.superjer.com/buffy/reviews.php">Mikejer</a>&rsquo;s site that there were people who hated season 6 for a third reason. Obviously, I know there are the kittens but there are also the folks who cannot bear the attempted rape in &ldquo;Seeing Red&rdquo; and the souled Spike storyline and now I know there are those to hate that Buffy may no longer be a superhero but a young woman making up fantasies in her head &ndash; they feel that Whedon let them down.</p>

<p>Tara has a bit of a cheek marching into the Summers&rsquo; home but she saves the day: a fact that I love a great deal. She earlier wears a spectacularly horrible top but that isn&rsquo;t the last bad top she&rsquo;ll wear.</p>
<p>There is some tremendous acting from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Kristine Sutherland in the scene where the latter tells Buffy that she will always be there for her. It brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<blockquote><p>I know you're afraid. I know the world feels like a hard place sometimes, but you've got people who love you. Your dad and I, we have all the faith in the world in you. We'll always be with you.</blockquote><br />

I almost felt sorry for Xander as he explains how pathetic he is (&ldquo;But then I left and ever since I've had this painful hole inside. And I'm the idiot that dug it out.&rdquo;) &ndash; Nicholas Brendon is great here. I also like the scene when Spike tells Xander all about his relationship with Buffy and in typical Scooby fashion Xander doesn&rsquo;t pay close enough attention.</p>

<p>Only two epsiodes to go.</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Gray Hour"</strong> (Sarah Fain &amp; Elizabeth Craft)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1545" title="dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle.jpg" alt="dollhouse-s01e04-sierra-and-adelle" width="533" height="267" /></p>
<p>I vowed to myself that if I disliked this episode of <em>Dollhouse</em> as much as &ldquo;Stage Fright&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t blog about it because I really didn&rsquo;t like writing about it at all.</p>
<p>This started off with heavy breathing which of course made us all roll our eyes only to find ourselves confounded by a woman in labour and Echo as doula. Quite why she was a doula in a remote location can only be explained by the symbolism throughout the rest of the episode. I don&rsquo;t care anymore if something is implausible; I&rsquo;m giving up worrying about that.</p>
<p>Eliza Dushku was at her best (so far in the series) as the reset Echo who comes to in a horrible place where men slap her. She made her can I go nows rather affecting. In addition, her awakening after her doula mission seemed more aware and less mechanical then usual.</p>
<p>Some folk complain that they are fed up with comparisons being made between ED and Dichen Lachman. However, when they play the exact same imprint I think a comparison is only fair and DL wins.</p>
<p>I also really like Enver Gjokaj as Victor/Lubov. I hope he keeps up this level of charm.</p>
<p>The scenes before we realised that Echo was Taffytastic were particularly unpleasant: multiple rape and the threat of further rape were just nasty and hard to take. I hope that as the series takes off in <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/eliza-dushku,24418/">episode 6</a> that this kind of scene is dropped. I would also like the now unquestioningly <a href="http://thelaverytory.blogspot.com/2009/03/blog-post.html">gratuitous shots of ED in her bra to stop too</a>.</p>
<p>Topher is mostly over the top, but as others have wondered, is he OTT or is Fran Kranz? I&rsquo;m going for the former for the moment.</p>
<p>I have determined that Olivia Williams has decided that subtle acting has no place in the <em>Dollhouse</em>:</p>

                  <p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Flight 1"</strong></p>
<p>A few remarks on episode 2 of season 2:</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537" title="mad-men-s02e021" src="/images/uploads/2009/03/mad-men-s02e021.jpg" alt="mad-men-s02e021" width="550" height="252" /><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vincent Kartheiser does a fine job as Pete on a weekly basis but in this he was amazing: enter this as your Emmy submission amazing. He was strangely vulnerable, lovable and appealing.</li>
<li>Peggy is a funny one. Sometimes I&rsquo;m not sure if she is supposed to be as inscrutable as she is. With an actor like Jon Hamm you can read his face and expressions and get an idea of what he may be thinking but Elisabeth Moss is often unreadable. She is either incredibly subtle or a bit wooden. I can&rsquo;t make up my mind.</li>
<li>I fear Don is not long for faithfulness. His relationship with Betty is brittle. I give him credit for trying but I really don&rsquo;t think he likes her.</li>
<li>Betty has little patience with her children but I thought she was spot on about her son being a little liar and lack of respect (what would she make of many modern parents&rsquo; relationships with their children?). The subtext of her remark regarding she knows what little boys are like wasn&rsquo;t lost on Don - which does make me think he is only being faithful because he knows that she knows. I though her snippiness in the kitchen was also justified after all it was Don who hinted that Francine&rsquo;s husband was unhappy. She does seem awfully privileged but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she isn&rsquo;t unhappy within the parameters of her life.</li>
<li>It is useful to keep in mind that <em>Mad Men</em> is a narrow view of the sixties. However, a limited view is a useful way to focus on specific issues.</li>
<li><a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news_print;_ylt=ApETrSd5cdOsEmh5MV8X9Shrbpt4?id=urn:newsml:tv.tvguide.com:20080801:5d83ea6a1bec2c66a1d98431fd6b88de__ER:2">Christina Hendricks was worried about coming across as racist</a> in her remarks to Sheila and to Paul but I think she would have been as unpleasant to anyone. Furthermore, Paul is a creep and a phoney (a great Orson Welles look-alike mind you) who made a move on Peggy after he bought her a sandwich back thirteen episodes ago.</li>
<li>On a shallow note, Alison Brie (what a great name, not as fab as January Jones but still great) is a lovely looking woman.</li><br />

These are quotes from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100350780">an interview with Joss Whedon about <em>Dollhouse</em> by Jacki Lyden</a> on npr's <em>All Things Considered</em> on 8th February 2008.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is uncomfortable.</li><br>
<li>True. A trope. Boring.</li><br>
<li>I'm think Joss fails in this respect. This series has reminded me of the Angel episode called "Billy" when Wes is handed his inner misogynist and tries to kill Fred. This is perhaps the most heavy-handed example of Joss and co failing to "show, don't tell" but "Stage Fright" is pretty unsubtle too. I do realise both episodes were not written by Joss himself but he's in charge. <em>Mad Men</em> is an exploration of misogyny but I have yet to hear anyone say the words "hate" and "women" unlike Wes who actually gets to hammer it home: "What do you tell a woman who has two black eyes?&nbsp; Nothing you haven't already told her twice."</li><br>
<li>I'm not angry. However, I am disappointed that such serious stuff is being presented via poor scripts.</li><br />

<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Stage Fright"</strong> (Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon)</p>
<p>Joss Whedon and crew are continuing to run on goodwill with me. After Joss gave me <em>Buffy</em> and to a lesser extent <em>Firefly</em> I have been willing to give him a chance with his other material because I know he can deliver. However, I am being stretched by <em>Angel</em>, <em>Dr Horrible</em> and his hit and miss comics (from <em>X-Men</em> to <em>Buffy</em>).</p>
<p>I am only persisting with <em>Angel</em> because it is part of the wider Buffyverse. Otherwise, its poor plotting, boring and inconsistent characters and lack of continuity would have turned me off.</p>
<p>Like <em>Angel</em> I have found myself saying throughout the first three episodes of <em>Dollhouse</em> &ldquo;but how?&rdquo; or &ldquo;but what?&rdquo; and then immediately saying, &ldquo;never mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I have to stop being at all concerned about how a super secret organization ever gets customers, how Topher manages to get any rest when he appears to be the only person monitoring the Actives&rsquo; activity (and we know that some missions are 24 hour), why Sierra wasn&rsquo;t programmed to be both a number one fan and someone kick-ass (like Echo was programmed to be singer and protector), why was Victor wiped as Lubov and then sent out again as Lubov the next day, and other things if I could be arsed.</p>
<p>There were two moments in this particular episode that made me feel uncomfortable. I have the right to be challenged and made to feel uneasy but this show doesn&rsquo;t deserve that right because it simply isn&rsquo;t good enough. So when the manager backhands Rayna I think we are meant to feel that this may be a deserving slap after ten years of frustration working for this demanding and ungrateful diva (albeit heartbreakingly unhappy). However, she is so poorly characterised that her unenviable position isn&rsquo;t made real and instead brings out a &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; about her &ldquo;plight&rdquo; attitude in people. However, it must actually be awful to be in a goldfish bowl for so long but Julia Roberts&rsquo; line in <em>Notting Hill</em> said it all and better than anything in this episode: &ldquo;I've been on a diet every day since I was nineteen, which basically means I've been hungry for a decade&rdquo;. So in short, that slap felt in bad taste and mean.</p>
<p><strong>This series hasn&rsquo;t even reached the level of reasonably entertaining and mildly thought-provoking and it needs to do that before it can show me a woman suffering and it not seem gratuitous</strong> which is what happened when the stalker made Audra sing. She is terrified and upset and can barely do as she is asked. This scene felt completely unnecessary because it simply confirmed what we knew: he was a nutter. Unless in a future episode Sierra remembers this moment and uses it to her advantage then all it did was make me feel bad.</p>
<p>However, as I have said before, I am tired of characters suffering (or having others suffer on their behalf) so that they can develop so even if this does happen in the future it is still boring.</p>
<p>I have found it scarily easy to write negatively about <em>Dollhouse</em> but after three episodes it is a failure as far as I am concerned. People say look at the first three episodes of <em>Buffy</em> because they weren&rsquo;t great but I don&rsquo;t accept that a series made ten years ago by a first time showrunner can be compared to his fourth series made in a climate that demands it hits the ground running.</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t it good enough? The dialogue is often heavy-handed. Too many characters say something to Echo that have double meanings that are basically groan-worthy, e.g., Rayna asks if Echo/Jordan was born in a lab or some such clunky thing. Adelle at the end justifies her actions to Lawrence by recapping the episode. Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;we split the atom &ndash; we made the bomb&rdquo; speechifying was a tad obvious. The acting is inconsistent. I&rsquo;ve on Eliza Dushku&rsquo;s side for the last two episodes but her mannered gesticulation spoiled the scene when she confronts the singer in front of the mirror. I am giving her a chance because at some time she will be asked to do something more than act Faith-like (other than the sexy be-suited businesswoman type from &ldquo;Ghost&rdquo;). However, it is worrying that the actress who is generally known as <em>not being very good</em> in <em>Neighbours</em> is more convincing and is showing a more effective range (that&rsquo;s one thing I did like about Sierra/Audra being kidnapped, Dichen Lachman&rsquo;s performance). Finally, based on the first three episodes, the storylines are unengaging, clich&eacute;d and derivative.</p>
<p>Phew, after all that generally incoherent moaning I might try for some positivity. To reiterate, I do like Lachman (and she shares my birthday) and I loved that Lubov was Victor after all. Hopefully, Mellie is still a doll too. The scene between Lubov and Mellie (Old Navy and coffee) was an actual treat with both actors interacting well (and funny dialogue too). I thought Olivia Williams was better in this episode too. I think she will be better as a character if they tone down the haughtiness. And dammit, I am interested in the Dolls&rsquo; awakening: the shake of Echo&rsquo;s head at the end was a great ending.</p>
<p>Of course, I will keep watching and my last three reviews of the series will involve the words &ldquo;Joss, how did I doubt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
