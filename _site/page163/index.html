                  <p><strong>Faith, Hope and Trick</strong> (David Greenwalt)</p>
<p><img id="image285" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/faith-hope-and-trick.jpg" alt="Faith in Faith, Hope and Trick" /></p>
<p>Faith is a totally five-by-five welcome addition to the show. She&rsquo;s dynamic, complex, violent and insecure and manages to create tension with Buffy and Xander (who really doesn&rsquo;t know which side his bread is buttered on).</p>
<p>Cordy is looking very tanned in this series so far. Not &ldquo;just been on holiday tanned&rdquo; but &ldquo;not been on holiday but supposed to have been tanned&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Willow is always gazing at Oz, which seems to be the show's shorthand for infatuation and insecurity. Cordy doesn&rsquo;t gaze at Xander even after she falls in love with him because she is neither infatuated or insecure.</p>
<p>Scott is sweet and cute but not very interesting.</p>
<p>Old slouchy is back to meander rather listlessly through the rest of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let me get this straight. I'm really back in school because the school board overruled you. Wow. That's like having your whole ability to do this job called into question, when you think about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think what my daughter's trying to say is...nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, sage. I love that smell. And marnox root. You know, a smidge of this mixed with a virgin's saliva...does something I know nothing about.&rdquo; (Marnox root? very clever)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing...much. Well, you know, I tried this spell to cure Angel, and I guess that was a bust. But since then, you know, small stuff: floating feather, fire out of ice, which next time I won't do on the bedspread. Are you mad at me?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, of course not, no. If I were, I would be making a strange clucking sound with my tongue.&rdquo; (Willow is trying so much magic off camera, it would have been good to see more of that in action &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t her show so we get Bangel interludes instead)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check out Slut-O-Rama and her Disco Dave.&rdquo; (Cordelia succinctly introduces Faith)</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sometimes I-I crave a non-fat yoghurt afterwards.&rdquo; (Buffy&rsquo;s face is a picture)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oz is a werewolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's a long story.&rdquo; &ldquo;I got bit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Apparently not that long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, as long as you don't go scratching at me or humping my leg, we're five-by-five, you know?&rdquo; (snort)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil.&rdquo; (this was going to be my title but there is an even better line)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really do need to find the fun, B. Uffy&rdquo; (Willow is cute again)</p>
<p>&ldquo;She's very personable. She gets along with my friends, my Watcher, my mom. Look, now she's getting along with my fries.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, Buffy...&rdquo; &ldquo;Plus, at school today, she was making eyes at my not-boyfriend. This is creepy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but I'm the one getting single-white-femaled here.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's probably good you were an only child.&rdquo; (well, Buffy was right about <em>Ted</em> and Joyce&rsquo;s attitude changes when Faith has her tied up in <em>This Year&rsquo;s Girl</em>, and Buffy learns just how hard it is to have a sibling)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, the only way you get a new Slayer is when the old Slayer dies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then that means you, when did you die? You never told me you died!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it was just for a few minutes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I hate this. I hate your life. Look, I know you didn't choose this, I know it chose you. I have tried to march in the Slayer Pride parade, but...I don't want you to die.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm not gonna die. I know how to do my job. Besides, like you said, I've got help now.&rdquo; (this is a lovely scene between mother and daughter &ndash; I like the gay pride reference (see also the coming out scene in <em><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12956661">X-Men 2</a></em>) and Joyce articulating the fear of every parent that their child dies before them)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm five-by-five, B, living entirely large, actually wondering about your problem.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I may not sleep in the nude and wrassle alligators...&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe it's time you started, 'cause obviously something in your bottle needs uncorking. What is it, the Angel thing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you know about Angel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just what your friends tell me: big love, big loss. You oughta deal and move on, but you're not. &ldquo;I got an idea: how about from now on, we don't hear from you on Angel or anything else in my life. Which, by the way, is my life.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you getting so strung out for, B?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are your lips still moving, F?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did I just hear a threat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you like to?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wow. Think you can take me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; (oh, tension already, Kendra was too uptight for Buffy while Faith is way too loose, or at least it seems that way for the moment. It is amazing how much feeling can be expressed in the initials B and F)</p>

                  <p><strong>Dead Man's Party</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>What a disaster this episode is and it has replaced "Bad Eggs" as my new worst episode of <em>BtVS</em> ever. At least "Bad Eggs" was just a poor monster of the week episode while this fails spectacularly at being serious because everyone except Buffy and Giles is just an arse.</p>
<p>The first mistake is treating Buffy as if she was a shirker (&ldquo;just because you ran away and abandoned your post&rdquo;) rather than someone who was traumatised. Obviously, only Buffy knows she killed a be-souled Angel but adding together Buffy&rsquo;s burdens since the moment Angel lost his soul, it should be clear to her friends (and to a degree her mother) that she was under enormous stress. Her friends knew she had killed an Angel who she still had strong feelings for and that she felt terribly guilty and responsible. Her mother had thrown her out, she had been expelled, she thought that her friends had been unable or at the least unwilling to help her (&ldquo;kick his ass&rdquo;) and she thought that she was alone. Give her a break.</p>
<p>When she does return (to rescue the Scoobies who appear collectively to be useless in a fight) she isn&rsquo;t given a genuine chance to explain. The behaviour of her oldest friends is scandalous and a mite implausible (early seasons Willow standing Buffy up? I could believe that of addled season six Willow but not this one), making out in front of her (followed by their concern in the next episode not to be too coupley) and turning up at dinner parties with a band and loads of uninvited mates.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip;are we supposed to think that anything they say to her at 1630 Revello Drive is in any way valid?</p>
<p>Willow&rsquo;s &ldquo;I didn't have anyone to talk to about all this scary life stuff&rdquo; is just selfish and anything Xander says is just, just, bloody, bloody horrible with this just being the worst: &ldquo;Look. I'm sorry that your honey was a demon, but most girls don't hop a Greyhound over boy troubles&rdquo;. &ldquo;Boy troubles&rdquo;! I hated Xander at that point and I don&rsquo;t think he ever really recovers in my eyes.</p>
<p>The second mistake is the zombie secondary plot which just gets in the way of <em>maybe</em> allowing the painful complaints from the Scoobies develop and make sense.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/2007/01/dip.jpg" id="image277" class="left" alt="The dip" /></p>
<p>I hate the hootenanny speech, we should have seen some unlikely Cordelia and Oz bonding while they hide in the cupboard under the stairs and, by missing a joke that already been set up earlier, the whole utter crapness of this episode is exposed. Cordelia: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the dip&rdquo;, later Buffy: &ldquo;Great. Thanks. Anybody else want to weigh in here? How about you by the dip?&rdquo; cut to Jonathon with no Cordelia in sight.<br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Everything is resolved by the team work and team spirit involved in defeating demons. Or it isn&rsquo;t and we see estrangement and lack of communications stretch into season seven. Oh good.</p>
<p>The highlight of this nightmare episode is Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance which is tremendous; under attack in the lounge she is awesome. And I admit that our glimpse of Ripper Giles (&ldquo;Like riding a bloody bicycle!&rdquo; and threatening Snyder) is always nice.</p>
<p>Dialogue:</p>
<p>"I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly."</p>
<p>"Private school? You mean, like jackets and kilts? You want me to get field hockey knees?" "What about home schooling? You know, it's not just for scary religious people anymore."</p>
<p class="imagebox-left"><img src="/images/uploads/2007/01/mom.jpg" id="image276" alt="Mom!" /><font color="#333399"><br />
"Do you wanna see my mom?" "Please." "MOM!"</font></p>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<p>"Unbelievable. "Do you like my mask? Isn't it pretty? It raises the dead!" Americans!"</p>
<p>"You're really enjoying this whole moral superiority thing, aren't you?" "It's like a drug!" "Fine! Okay. I'm the bad. I can take my lumps...for a while." "All right. I'll stop giving you a hard time...runaway." "Will!" "I'm sorry! Quitter." "Whiner." "Bailer." "Harpy." "Delinquent." "Tramp." "Bad seed." "Witch." "Freak."<br />
(what moral superiority? I wish it had been Willow's only drug though)</p>

                  <p><strong>Anne</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image274" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/buffy-is-back.jpg" alt="Buffy " /></div><br />
There are two entirely different storylines in this and it didn't really work to have them interspersed with each other. I like the gloominess of the Anne story but I also think how much you enjoy this episode depends on much you care about Lily and I cared a lot. Julia Lee gave a lovely, sad, sweet performance. The Scoobies coping back home is no match for Anne&rsquo;s story and the Xander/Cordelia subplot just tees me off. Cordelia is so looking forward to seeing Xander, but their awkward reunion makes me cross because it makes no sense; they were happy at the end of last season and it feels contrived and not particularly interesting.  Her feelings for him are just being set up for a fall and it seems that happiness just isn&rsquo;t on the Joss agenda for any couple. It is unpleasant that Xander when he's peeved can consider the notion that Cordelia is only fit for &ldquo;bait&rdquo;. A dream gives me the first of many unwelcome Bangel moments of season three and, with a couple of notable exceptions, Buffy&rsquo;s dreams are usually cack.There is an hilarious moment in the blood bank when someone says &ldquo;ow&rdquo; off screen and Buffy looks discomforted. Finally, I love the super fight sequence with the huge set, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunga_Munga">hunga munga</a> and Lily discovering her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, Big Boy. Come and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought, but in a way, I feel like we took her punning for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img id="image273" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/lily-and-anne.jpg" class="left" alt="Lily and Anne" />&ldquo;Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway. <a href="http://www.wild-harvest.com/pages/chanterelle.htm">Chanterelle</a> was part of my exotic phase.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's nice. It's a mushroom.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is? That's really embarrassing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Um, well, it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, before that, I was following this loser <a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/caleb/">preacher</a> and calling myself Sister Sunshine.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do they call you at home?&rdquo; (with her lack of reply, I say, poor Lily)<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here.&rdquo; (Ken gives the game away)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't. I blame you. You&rsquo;ve been this huge influence on her, guiding her. You had this whole relationship with her behind my back. I feel like you've taken her away from me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn't make Buffy who she is.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who exactly is she?&rdquo; (Joyce isn&rsquo;t exactly as livid as I&rsquo;d like but at least there is this little conversation for her to make a point)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This'll probably go faster if we split up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I come with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, where did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?&rdquo; (poor Lily)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?&rdquo; &ldquo;Gandhi?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I be &ldquo;Anne&rdquo;'?&rdquo; (if it gives you strength)</p>

                  <p><strong>Becoming I and II </strong>(Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>I am just about to commit sacrilege but the first twenty minutes of this two parter are boring. I admit this is the third viewing but unlike many BtVS episodes third time was one time too many. Kendra&rsquo;s reappearance perked me up but I am surprised in a show that challenges in so many ways that it is a shame that Buffy was allowed to make fun of how she talked. At least, Buffy didn&rsquo;t go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fish_Called_Wanda">Kevin Kline </a>on us and make fun of Tara&rsquo;s stutter (they left that to Faith).</p>
<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t Oz told about Willow&rsquo;s spell the first time? Why did anyone think that Willow &ldquo;may be the best person to do this&rdquo;? Surely, a real witch like Amy should have been drafted in. I&rsquo;m not complaining that Willow was a witch and a powerful one at that but I feel there should have been more of a build up (and <em>I Only Have Eyes For You</em> wasn&rsquo;t enough, imo) before this revealing of Willow&rsquo;s talent and putting her at risk. As Giles says: &ldquo;channelling such potent magicks through yourself, it could open a door that you may not be able to close&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Usually Andy leaves the snorting over fashion faux pas to me but even he was prompted to remark how Willow&rsquo; purple outfit had the effect of making her skin look purple too.</p>
<p><img id="image270" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/Willow%20gets%20her%20mojo%20on.jpg" class="left" alt="Willow gets her mojo on" />Willow: her resolve face is quite pathetic really but the moment when the magic takes hold of her is one of the iconic images from BtVS. It must be deliberately ironic that she is felled by a stack of library books.<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Xander: he is rapidly becoming my least favourite regular by a long way (not that when I think of it he could be anything but my least favourite). However, I am inclined to agree with him that Angelus needs to be eliminated, he is a killer, and no matter if his soul is restored it can be removed from him and it will all begin again. (Obviously, I&rsquo;m a liberal and didn&rsquo;t really write that.) Moving on to the controversial moment when he doesn&rsquo;t tell Buffy that Willow is going to try the spell again: I think he is right not to tell her because it might have lead to hesitation at a crucial time but what he was not right to do was to get Willow involved.</p>
<p>Spike: it's good to see him on his feet again. I&rsquo;m no shipper but I do prefer Spike and Buffy together rather that Angel and Buffy. However, I do object to how much she hits him. <img id="image271" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/Spike%20shrugs.jpg" class="left" alt="Spike shrugs" />The unnecessary thumping starts in this episode and their sado-masochistic relationship hardly ever lets up. Another iconic moment occurs when he shrugs when he thinks Angel is going to kill Buffy (actually, this makes no sense because if Buffy dies then Angel&rsquo;s plan comes to fruition and no more &ldquo;Happy Meals with legs&rdquo;). The scenes with Joyce are classic: &ldquo;You hit me with an axe one time, remember? &ldquo;Get the hell away from my daughter&rdquo;&rdquo; and the uncomfortable silence in the living room.<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Joyce: her reaction is understandable and she doesn&rsquo;t really mean it when she tells Buffy never to return. Joyce has a bigger claim to feeling betrayed than any other character. Every single person that she knows who knows Buffy has lied to her persistently. Now she knows why Mr Giles has been so attentive to her daughter and she has a right to be livid.</p>
<p>Kendra: I liked Kendra a lot. Bianca Lawson drew the short straw regarding accents but she was charming in her brief appearances and gave us the delight of &ldquo;Mr Pointy&rdquo;. Her death is a shocker but I do feel that Dru takes her too easily.</p>
<p>Cordelia: not much to note except she has the best line: &ldquo;Why don't you just wait here to find out if it worked, see if he phones you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles: the use of Jenny Calendar (and a welcome reappearance by Robia LaMorte) to get information from him was horrible using his grief as a weapon and his brutal torture is cleverly implied.</p>
<p>Buffy:  Angelus is right: Buffy falls for it every single time and more people die. I&rsquo;m not surprised she was so depressed by season 6. <img id="image269" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/Buffy%20Me.jpg" class="left" alt="Buffy Me" />In the end, Buffy does find the strength to kill Angel and what makes Whedon a brave and adventurous writer is this comes after his soul is restored making &ldquo;close your eyes&rdquo; an even more powerful moment. The best moment in the show is when SMG shows her class in the scene when Angelus is taunting her (&ldquo;No weapons. No friends. No hope. Take all that away and what's left?) and she opens her eyes to say &ldquo;Me.&rdquo;<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't touch me! You have fish hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These public displays of affection are not acceptable in my school. This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah! Where they teach lunch.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just give me a reason to kick you out, Summers. Just give me a reason.&rdquo; &ldquo;How about because you're a tiny, impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know. What happened to Angel wasn't his fault.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, but what happened to Ms. Calendar is. You can paint this any way you want. But the way I see it is that you wanna forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder so you can get your boyfriend back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This means I can't help you study for tomorrow's final.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, I'll wing it. Of course, if we go to Hell by then, I won't have to take them. Or maybe I'll be taking them forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a long time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even have chainsaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you, just some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good and evil?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wow. Good guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willow. Uh, she told me to tell you...&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kick his ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're not real.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sure, I'm real.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I want.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why would they make you see me?&rdquo; &ldquo;You're right. Let's go.&rdquo;</p>
