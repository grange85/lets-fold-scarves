                  <p><strong>After Life</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>The last five minutes of this are superb - worthy of just quoting Buffy's monologue (though that doesn't do justice to what is essentially a dialogue between SMG and James Marsters despite Spike's silence).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/after-life-buffy-i-think-i-was-in-heaven.jpg' alt='After Life - Spike and Buffy' /></div></p>
<blockquote><p>I was happy. Wherever I...was...I was happy. At peace. I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time...didn't mean anything...nothing had form...but I was still me, you know? And I was warm...and I was loved...and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or, any of it, really...but I think I was in heaven. And now I'm not. I was torn out of there. Pulled out...by my friends. Everything here is...hard, and bright, and violent. Everything I feel, everything I touch...this is Hell. Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that...knowing what I've lost...They can never know. Never.</blockquote></p>
<p>(Not until that pesky musical episode anyway.)
<p>I really really dislike the others when they pile into the living room and effectively terrorize Buffy leaving it to Dawn (after Spike understandably scarpers) to tell them to back off.

<p>And, I can hardly write this for laughing at the incongruity that my son who would wear pyjamas 24/7 if we, ahem, let him, exclaimed, "What is Willow wearing?" when Alyson Hannigan appeared clad in what can only be called a plush synthetic bathroom set.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/after-life-tara-and-willow-and-toilet-lid-cover.jpg' alt='After Life - Willow wearing a toilet lid cover' /></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bathroom-set.jpg' alt='A bathroom set' /></div>Unbelievably in all seven seasons of <em>Buffy</em> when some pretty terrible clothes were worn this takes the biscuit. It is seriously vile.</p>
<p>It also detracts from Buffy's very convincing thank you even though she struggles to disguise her revulsion at the realisation that it is ALL Willow's fault.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/after-life-buffy-says-thanks.jpg' alt='After Life - Buffy says thanks' /></div>
<div style="text-align:center;">(Actually maybe it is just the top she has a problem with.)</div></p>
<p>Why does Tara wear a bra to bed? (What? Everybody does?) Whatever. I find that distracts me from Tara and Willow's conversation as well as the arm stroking and the fact they are in bed together - but maybe that's just me. Anyway - moving on - how dozy are they that it does not occur to them that Buffy's lack of gratitude may be related to the place they just took her from? This line tickles me - "Right. No need to be in a big furry hurry" because clearly Willow ignores her own advice later on.</p>
<p>Serious stuff and big trouble ahead: </p>
<blockquote><p>Tara: "Well, what was it talking about? Did you understand it?"<br />
Willow: "Well, I understood the words, but...no."</blockquote></p>
<p> (<em>It</em> said "The blood dried on your hands, didn't it?")</p>
<p>The scene between Tara and Xander (when he presumably talks to the only person he can about Willow's behaviour) is unusual because I can't recall another scene with just the two of them and Tara's defence of her girlfriend is just that - defensive.</p>
<p>I feel genuinely sad when Willow and Tara are doing the spell together and Willow breaks their connection and finishes it herself. She has come a long way from floating the rose.</p>
<p>I read some other analyses of <em>BtVS</em> and I feel shallow that I get amused by "furry hurry" lines because it conjures up <em>that top</em> and because I wonder why Tara is wearing a bra but then I revel in the fact that <em>BtVS</em> can handle any interpretation thrown at it. It works on so many levels and I think I know where mine is.</p>

                  <p>I have scrapped my next candidate in this <strike>prodigious</strike> prestigious (you nit) series because I have just read "Anywhere But Here" (#10 of <em>Buffy</em> season 8*). </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/image006.jpg' title='Buffy 8.10 Willow and television&rsquo;s Tina Fey'><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/image006.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Buffy 8.10 Willow and television&rsquo;s Tina Fey' /></a></div><br />
So I am moving on to my next favourite left-handed person I <strike>love</strike> admire who is <a href="http://www.tina-fey.org/">Tina Fey</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/tina-fey.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Tina Fey' /></div><br />
 My appreciation of Tina Fey is based on <em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>30 Rock</em> and nothing else. I&rsquo;m British, I have never seen <em>Saturday Night Live</em> but since I know stuff and thence I do know that it&rsquo;s not actually my sort of thing and that would seem to make my like of <em>30 Rock</em> a touch baffling since it is about a programme <em>rather</em> like <em>SNL</em>. But actually, it&rsquo;s not really baffling at all, Jack and Kenneth and Liz and Tracy and Jenna are hilarious comic creations from the mind of Tina.  And her mind is brilliant because it thinks of lines like "Those shoes are definitely bi-curious" (more quotes below) and when she's interviewed in <em>Playboy</em> she says things like </p>
<blockquote><p>But for some of these other chicks, the closest they can get to a body like that is to remove everything that&rsquo;s there and add a little something on top. It&rsquo;s like the ladies you see in Playboy.</blockquote></p>
<p>And she wears glasses and she has a scar. Read <a href="http://dorothysurrenders.blogspot.com/2007/11/girls-do-make-passes-at-girls-who-wear.html">Dorothy Surrenders</a> and she'll explain better.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/normal_geek.jpg' alt='Tina Fey is a Geek' /></div></p>
<blockquote><p>
Jack: Sure...I gotcha. New York, third-wave feminist, college-educated, single and pretending to be happy about it, over-scheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says 'healthy body image' on the cover, and every two years you take up knitting for... a week.<br />
Pete: That is dead on!<br />
Liz: What, are you going to guess my weight now?<br />
Jack: You don't want me to do that.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: If I'm gonna be with someone, it has to be a guy.<br />
Gretchen: You sound pretty sure about that.<br />
Liz: What can I say, I love a bald spot and a hairy back.<br />
Gretchen: You're alone there.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Jack: Human contact is important Lemon. I can tell from your stress level that you have not been touched in any way in quite some time. Not caressed, not massaged, not even groped on the subway.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>
Liz: I hate going up to Donaghy's office even for something normal. I always feel like I'm entering the Death Star.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: No, Tracy took advantage of my 'white guilt,' which is supposed to be used only for good like over-tipping and supporting Barack Obama.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Gentleman: Excuse me, is this seat taken?<br />
Liz: [Sighs] Really dude? I got to move my coat? There are like 4 empty seats over there - can't you just be cool?<br />
[Gentleman leaves]<br />
Jenna: That guy wanted to buy you a drink!<br />
Liz: Really? But I already have a drink. Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks?</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: [on the phone] Hi, my name is Liz Lemon and I received flowers from your shop tonight and I can't tell who they're from. [pause] No, no, I did read the card but it's not signed.... no, I'm not with so many men that it's impossible for me to guess...well, that is just...oh, well you know what, I found the card, actually, they're from your mom, so tell your gay mom I said thanks! [hangs up] </blockquote><br />
OK, she isn't credited with writing all these lines but she's in charge.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/tina-fey2.jpg' alt='Tina Fey peeking over her glasses' /></div><br />
And proof she is left-handed is in this compilation of all her scenes in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE_SMJHCZ4">Mean Girls</a></em> (PS Lindsay Lohan is so lovely at the beginning of this film).
<p>
*However, if you are going to draw Tina Fey then maybe glasses would help and please <em>give her a waist</em>!</p>

                  <p><em>The Guardian</em>'s blogging editorial policy seems determined to be as divisive as possible regarding gender. <em>The Guardian</em> used to be one of my quick links but recently I removed it because I was fed up with being sucked into a Comment is Free blog full of mutual hatred just because I was looking for some news to read. I still have their arts blogs feeds set up in Netvibes because they are interesting. However, <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/01/can_a_woman_pilot_a_war_novel.html">this piece</a> by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20060122.shtml">John Sutherland</a> is mind-bogglingly stupid. He asks whether women can write about war by going on about joysticks and shrivelling balls when he hears a woman's voice coming from a cockpit and, without irony, uses an article by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Buchanan#Feminism">Pat Buchanan</a> to illustrate a point. (Hang on, maybe, the <em>whole thing</em> is ironic! And maybe it's <em>meant</em> to be funny!) It is painful to read because of sentences like this </p>
<blockquote><p>Can a class of writer so institutionally and historically disengaged from a subject write a classic (or even a good) novel on it?</blockquote></p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Why, with all those "women's subjects" at her disposal, did Kennedy venture into this most exclusive of manly enclaves?</blockquote></p>
<p>I shall certainly read <em>Can Jane Eyre Be Happy?</em> and <em>Is Heathcliff a Murderer?</em> in a different light now.</p>
<p>But still, a good thing has come out of it - I actually quite fancy reading <em>Day</em> by AL Kennedy now.</p>
<p>PS Even it is written in humour this type of article is all over <em>The Guardian</em> these days and they <em>are</em> serious.</p>

                  <p>I am aware this is aimed at modern young people but it was an interesting experience answering the questions. The original is <a href="http://wbarratt.indstate.edu/socialclass/social_class_on_campus.htm">here</a> and I have deleted some questions which were irrelevant.</p>
<p>If your father went to college before you started<br />
<em>My dad left school at 15</em><br />
If your mother went to college before you started<br />
<em>My mum left school at 17</em><br />
If you have any relative who is an attorney, physician, or professor<br />
<em>One of my uncles was a teacher</em><br />
If your family was the same or higher class than your high school teacher<br />
<em>No, but I was friends with the daughter of a high school teacher</em><br />
If you had a computer at home when you were growing up<br />
<em>Very unlikely in the 70s</em><br />

<em>No &ndash; we never travelled abroad except for when my dad was stationed overseas</em><br />

If you have ever flown anywhere on a commercial airline<br />
<em>Yes &ndash; but only to come home from Germany and we usually drove</em><br />
If your parents took you to museums and art galleries as a child or teen<br />
<em>No</em><br />
If you were unaware of how much heating bills were for your family<br />
