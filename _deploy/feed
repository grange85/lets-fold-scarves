        <title>Saboteur (1942)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saboteur&lt;/em&gt; is a thoroughly likeable thriller with charming leads. It’s like a cross between The &lt;em&gt;39 Steps&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;North by Northwest&lt;/em&gt; and there are several set pieces that wouldn’t be out of place in any of Hitchcock’s best films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brightly lit sunny scene at the ranch with sweet Susie and her suavely sinister grandfather played by Otto Kruger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thejar.hitchcock.zone/1000/Saboteur%20(1942)/0191.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Robert Cummings and Otto Kruger with sweet Susie&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circus caravan sequence is beautifully written with lovely engaging characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thejar.hitchcock.zone/1000/Saboteur%20(1942)/0439.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Circus folk&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love scenes set in ghost towns. Perhaps they are romantic because they are a rarity in the UK. The scene in the office reminded me of a point and click adventure as they locate the tripod and the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thejar.hitchcock.zone/1000/Saboteur%20(1942)/0503.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Robert Cuimmings and Priscilla Lane in the ghost town&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale at the Statue of Liberty is brilliant and very exciting (though as has been pointed out it really should be the hero hanging by a thread not the villain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thejar.hitchcock.zone/1000/Saboteur%20(1942)/0992.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;Norman Lloyd hanging on to the Statue of Liberty&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane were lovely and fresh and an age appropriate couple.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suspicion (1941)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Johnnie may be played by Cary Grant but he’s actually not at all charming but unattractively weak, lazy, and manipulative. And infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/27/0081.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cary Grant is creepy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And creepy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ending is so bad. It’s almost as weak as Johnnie’s character. I prefer to think of the film ending just after Johnnie walks up the stairs with the glass of milk and Lina sits up in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/27/0950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lina has her suspicions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are more interesting than Johnnie and Lina: Nigel Bruce as the lovable Beaky, Auriol Lee (who was killed in a car crash on her way back home from filming this) as the crime writer, and her lesbian friend played by Nondas Metcalf who is uncredited but thanks to the Internet her life can be filled in by calling at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bucksco.michenerartmuseum.org/artists/nondas-metcalfe&quot;&gt;James A. Michener Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; (I love the Internet).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mr. and Mrs. Smith (1941)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This has a promising beginning and it is thoroughly enjoyable (especially the great sequence in the restaurant) until the moment that she realises he has no intention of telling her they aren’t married. And then it falls apart with a series of completely unfunny events cumulating in the ski lodge finale when she succumbs to him and the entire point of the film is lost because they do have sex and they are still not married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/26/0074.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mr and Mrs Smith shaving&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on the cat &lt;a href=&quot;https://cinemacats.com/mr-and-mrs-smith-1941/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I get that for him it is exciting to think of having a mistress instead of a wife but it is also really creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-rate nature of the film is emphasised by too many unflattering similarities to &lt;em&gt;The Awful Truth&lt;/em&gt; which is one of the all-time great screwball comedies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the film’s general failure it boasts one of Carole Lombard’s most brilliant performances. She is effortlessly funny and sexy. To think this was her second last film and then gone. I believe she would have ruled TV. Her scars are really noticeable too. Had she reached the time in her life when she decided not to care about hiding them? She certainly appeared to lack vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Foreign Correspondent (1940)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This used to be one of my favourite secret Hitchcock films. &lt;em&gt;Secret&lt;/em&gt; as in less well known and appreciated. Following on from &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; was always going to be hard so it appears that Hitch thought he would make a thriller just the ones he made in Britain. And rather like the majority of his British thrillers, this doesn’t really hang together. The film is a weird hybrid of big Hollywood budget (as reflected in the sets) and British quirkiness but what was marginally acceptable in a low budget British film seems careless in such surroundings. Of course, there are brilliant set pieces and sequences such as the rain-soaked assassination, the coat caught in the windmill gear, Edmund Gwenn attempts at murder, and the plane crash, but the plotting and general storytelling is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/25/0257.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Umbrellas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/25/0638.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edmund Gwenn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/25/0925.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plane crash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny Jones and Carol Fisher are rather dull characters (though the actors are perfectly fine) and it’s not even Johnny who saves Van Meer but the charismatic Scott ffolliott played beautifully by George Sanders. I do like Herbert Marshall who was such a dependable actor whether hero or villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/25/0159.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Laraine Day and Herbert Marshall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The torture scene is deeply unpleasant and cruel. While I’m aware that torture is unpleasant and cruel I don’t really need to see it in a film with such light tone. The torture scene does result in an interesting tableau as the villains (and George Sanders) watch and listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/25/0830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Watching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally being Hitchcock it is very funny though I take issue with the commentators on the documentary on this particular DVD release (&lt;em&gt;Personal History: Foreign Hitchcock&lt;/em&gt;) who seem to think it had something to do with Robert Benchley who is reasonably amusing in an entirely Robert Benchley way but I rather think that the Charles Bennett who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Knew Too Much&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Secret Agent&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Young and Innocent&lt;/em&gt;, may have been a tiny bit more important on the humour front.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rebecca (1940)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another film I have seen many, many times. I wonder if it may even be the first Hitchcock film I ever saw. Therefore it is hard to see it afresh. The one main thing that struck me after watching all of Hitchcock’s British films is the sheer glossiness of it and the money pouring off the screen. Ironically though the very first shot in it is a model! The model itself is of a very Hollywood idea of a large house on a country estate. I know it is often described as a Gothic romance but I think the house was probably a bit more subdued in Daphne du Maurier’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a fan of Laurence Oliver though I can’t put my finger on just why but he is perfect as Maxim. He was only ten years older than Fontaine but both come across as older and younger than their actual ages. He perfectly portrays Maxim’s inability to communicate and his patronising manner which leads him to make poor decisions but when he tells his new wife the truth his vulnerability shows through. I can’t actually imagine spending the rest of my life with a man with such communication issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really irritating that the lead/narrator doesn’t have a name. It makes writing about her really hard. Joan Fontaine is very good indeed as the girl. I think it is a jolly hard role for any Hollywood actress to play. They are, after all, by definition glamorous. One moment that I can really relate to is when she panics after breaking the ornament. I’ve done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/24/0344.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plain Fontaine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word cad was invented for George Sanders’ performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/24/0521.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;George Sanders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real star of the film is Judith Anderson. Despite the multiple adaptations of Rebecca, no actor has ever played Mrs Danvers with such malevolence. You can literally feel the effect she has on the second Mrs de Winter, she makes my skin crawl nearly 80 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/24/0680.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florence Bates is fabulous as Mrs van Hopper who despite her awful personality isn’t actually wrong about the relationship between the two de Winters to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/24/0059.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fontaine/Bates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a richness to filmmaking that is absent from your average film of 1940. Was there ever somebody on screen as vulgar as she is as sits in bed plucking her eyebrows or stubbing out her cigarette in a pot of cold cream? How many scenes were as perfectly choreographed as the intimidation of the new Mrs de Winter by underwear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a total aside, I have always been bothered by how quickly they drive to and from Cornwall to London. It takes at least 4 and a half hours now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy to put &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; into context. It wasn’t just an ordinary film by any standards. It was a big budget prestige special film - not quite as special as &lt;em&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/em&gt; but still a major film. &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; was (and is) an enormously successful novel and David O. Selznick wanted to make it as faithfully as possible (with &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; caveat) whereas Hitchcock wanted to do with it what he had done with any other adaptation of his which is to take it as a jumping off point. And to be honest I’m glad that Selznick had his way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jamaica Inn (1939)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a cracking British film with a superb cast. It doesn’t seem particularly Hitchcockian though despite these familiar names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/23/0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JB Priestley too&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles Laughton is brilliant (as always). He had this ability to keep this side of ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/23/0870.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JCharles Laughton&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a couple of other potential hams keeping to the right side: Leslie Banks and Robert Newton. In truth, Robert Newton (who I’m not a fan of) is actually rather bland. The role doesn’t help. Leslie Banks may have preferred not to have his face mutilated during the Great War but he made the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/23/0719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leslie Banks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the cast is an impressive list of British actors: Marie Ney, Emlyn Williams (looking rather fetching in his gypsy get up), Basil Radford, Wylie Watson, et al. However, it is the Irish Maureen O’Hara who really shines. She is stunning looking (but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the actor is interesting) but she was a commanding presence despite her youth (19 I assume). Unfortunately, I associate her with John Wayne and the disagreeable &lt;em&gt;The Quiet Man&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/23/0617.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maureen O’Hara&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model work during the wreck was most impressive and the inn was an interesting though stagy looking set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/23/0030.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;model of a ship&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film suffered from a compressed adaptation of the original material (of the bestseller by Daphne du Maurier). Mary’s attitude felt forced - after all she hardly knew the people she was angry with Jem for giving up to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Reg Allen motorcycle shop on the corner of Grosvenor Road and Hatfield Road was a bit of an oddity but it felt timeless so to see it closed is sad but I guess inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Lady Vanishes (1938)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so familiar with this film that I do wonder what there is to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are some random notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I adore the model shot at the beginning. I think that Orson Welles missed a trick when he didn’t include models in &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; if he really did say that the RKO studio was “the greatest electric train set a boy ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDGmygzX7rw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chap who put that up thinks it’s awful! Personally I think awful is the insertion of a modern horse race in MGM’s 1935 &lt;em&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/em&gt; when Vronsky falls off his mount. MGM was the richest studio at the time and stunts like that had been done successfully for years so there is no reason for them to be so cheap (and particularly since the rest of the sequence is so exciting). Hitchcock having fun with his own train set isn’t really that terrible a thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave had textbook onscreen chemistry. I know that Andy disagrees but I could have done with seeing that chemistry between Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll in &lt;em&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/em&gt;. He is a bit of arse at the beginning though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/22/0601.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Redgrave and Lockwood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/22/0625.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Redgrave and Lockwood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/22/0644.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Redgrave and Lockwood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple more notable duos in &lt;em&gt;The Lady Vanishes&lt;/em&gt;. One pair seem more boorish the more I watch the film but it would have been shorter if Charters and Caldicott hadn’t been cricket obsessed rotters. Linden Travers makes the most of a small role as “Mrs” Todhunter. Lots of things can be said about Hitchcock and women and most of it is annoying bollocks about the Hitchcock blonde (go on pretend that Ingrid Bergman is blonde (though I concede it is a thing post Grace Kelly) but he knew how to populate his film with interesting and rounded female characters and how to get good performances from them. Looking further into this film we have the high-heeled nun Catherine Lacey memorable for her change of heart, Googie Withers and co as Lockwood’s chums (think how funny their dialogue is), and scary Mary Clare as the steely baroness. And May Whitty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite scene is the fight in the luggage van which is beautifully choreographed, rather tense, and bizarrely at the same time hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Young and Innocent (1937)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have always loved Nova Pilbeam in this film and we named a cat after her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Pilbeam stretching in the sun&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/37035331/in/photolist-jLPVu-e6F2v-9AK9H-979Qu-5kDXe-5kDXU-4MrCD-4gPjj-4gQrv-4gQrx-4gQrk-4gPjc-4gPj7-3JNbh-3BWod-3z3Mo-3z3KN-3hVi7-3gWHy-3bw8P-37r7t-35zwD-35zwY-395Wp-35CnN-2XLFi-2XLFU-2WwRo-2WwZb-QbGc-K7b8-kF4w-QbEd-QbCa-QbyE-96rx-Qbvz-Qbtc-Qbme-2YK1d-2WzdX-2Bo36-2Bo2F-K7cU-gsLQ-aMhX-96rM-96rK-Qbne-Qbki&quot; data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/29/37035331_187cdb38a9_z.jpg?zz=1&quot; alt=&quot;Pilbeam stretching in the sun&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we should name any dog we have Towser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0400.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0400.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an enjoyable romp of a film but at the same I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any other British Hitchcock film that has as much resemblance to real life as this does. It actually unwittingly tells us quite a lot about mid-thirties Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Britain in which an obviously bright girl was clearly not destined for university or a job but was heading straight into marriage. One where said young woman may be in charge of the household but she has a maid and a cook to ensure that all she has to worry about is the film&amp;rsquo;s plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0325.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cars were still being started with cranks and there were still plenty of horse drawn vehicles about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0131.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0219.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrol stations weren&amp;rsquo;t really stations but places where little boys would operate the single pump for you (perhaps this was a Hitchcock touch but you can imagine him witnessing this and noting it down for later use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0247.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roadside cafes were called carmen&amp;rsquo;s shelters and lorry drivers were called carmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0431.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you could get huge mugs of tea there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0445.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Britain with lots of smoking and very fancy party hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0569.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps more damning, a Britain with tramps and dosshouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0712.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And less damning, a Britain where broken china wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrown away but was mended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0731.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a Britain where bands played live in hotels in blackface (any good reason for that?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0905.jpg&quot; width=&quot;636&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alma fact: continuity&lt;br /&gt;
Transport: cars, a train&lt;br /&gt;
Animals: dog&lt;br /&gt;
