I"><p><em>Saboteur</em> is a thoroughly likeable thriller with charming leads. It’s like a cross between The <em>39 Steps</em> and <em>North by Northwest</em> and there are several set pieces that wouldn’t be out of place in any of Hitchcock’s best films.</p>

<p>The brightly lit sunny scene at the ranch with sweet Susie and her suavely sinister grandfather played by Otto Kruger.</p>

<p>The circus caravan sequence is beautifully written with lovely engaging characters.</p>

<p>I love scenes set in ghost towns. Perhaps they are romantic because they are a rarity in the UK. The scene in the office reminded me of a point and click adventure as they locate the tripod and the telescope.</p>

<p>The finale at the Statue of Liberty is brilliant and very exciting (though as has been pointed out it really should be the hero hanging by a thread not the villain).</p>

<p>Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane were lovely and fresh and an age appropriate couple.</p>
