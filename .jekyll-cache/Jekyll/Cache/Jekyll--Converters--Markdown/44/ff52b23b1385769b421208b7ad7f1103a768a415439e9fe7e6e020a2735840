I"*<p>Johnnie may be played by Cary Grant but he’s actually not at all charming but unattractively weak, lazy, and manipulative. And infuriating.</p>

<p>(And creepy.)</p>

<p>That ending is so bad. It’s almost as weak as Johnnie’s character. I prefer to think of the film ending just after Johnnie walks up the stairs with the glass of milk and Lina sits up in bed.</p>

<p>The following are more interesting than Johnnie and Lina: Nigel Bruce as the lovable Beaky, Auriol Lee (who was killed in a car crash on her way back home from filming this) as the crime writer, and her lesbian friend played by Nondas Metcalf who is uncredited but thanks to the Internet her life can be filled in by calling at the <a href="https://bucksco.michenerartmuseum.org/artists/nondas-metcalfe">James A. Michener Art Museum</a> (I love the Internet).</p>
