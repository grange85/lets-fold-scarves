  content: "*Note* I don't write comments... I write novels. I'm sorry. Hope you don't
    mind too much.\r\n\r\nI loved both Oz and Willow, and Willow and Tara. I tend
    to get more deeply tied, emotionally, to Oz and Willow (despite wanting it to
    be for the other couple) because Willow and Tara are so private that writing in
    a lot of the deep emotional stuff must have been challenging, I guess. I love
    Joss but I wish he'd done better with Willow and Tara's relationship. I would
    have loved to have been pulled in more than I was. And I'm an empath so I'm not
    lacking in the emotional area. *laugh*\r\n\r\nTwo of my favorite episodes, ones
    that I STILL cannot stop myself from crying during (poor grammar there. ack.),
    are the episodes in Season 4 when Oz leaves and when he returns. (and btw, I've
    seen all 7 seasons probably more than 20 times and yet the tears always come)
    When Oz left, I thought I would die. \"Oz. Don't you love me?\" *eyes start watering*
    \"My whole life, I've never loved anything else.\" *waterworks!*  \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    they're both oddballs and I'm an oddball, and they needed each other so much and
    fit together so perfectly. I didn't think they could ever replace him. Actually,
    I just assumed it would be a temporary leaving and he'd come back. Then they introduce
    Tara into Willow's life and things start to grow and I find myself hoping for
    them. Then Oz comes back and I was torn, slightly. I loved Oz... he was a great
    character really. Seth Green played that role so well. But I'd fallen for Tara
    already and didn't want Willow to go back to Oz... but at the same time I wanted
    Oz back on the show. *rofl* I dunno if they could have made it work with him on
    the show but not with Willow... but I still miss Oz.\r\n\r\nThat said, I still
    love Willow and Tara so much that I have a tug-of-war inside me whenever I try
    to figure out which coupling I like better. And there are moments between Willow
    and Tara that are beautiful and unforgettable too. \"I am, ya know?\" \"What?\"
    \"Yours.\" --  And the mystical and passionate scene where Willow goes into the
    nether realm to find Buffy when she and Faith switched. -- Also, the episode \"Family\"
    in season 5 is another favorite of mine... especially the dance scene at the end
    when Willow and Tara talk to each other and explain just how deeply they love
    one another and why.\r\n.....\r\nI just wanted to add a note about the main \"bad
    guys\" of each season. I noticed you touched a little on that on the blog about
    the episode in season 5 \"No Place Like Home\" I think it was? You talked about
    how Glory was annoying but you still liked her better than Adam. I'd have to definitely
    agree on that... but yeah she definitely annoys me a lot. Still, with regards
    to bad guys I hated most... above Adam and Glory, even above \"The Trio\" in Season
    6 (though they aren't truly the biggest bad guy in that season), I hated the Master.
    \ HOLY CRAP... I cannot begin to express how much I hated that guy. The makeup
    was awful for one thing, but I coulda handled that. It was his demeanor that made
    me want to make a voodoo doll of him or something. For a venerable, revered vampire
    who had lived as long as he had and, you think, should have learned some patience
    and maturity and the ability to deal with tough situations... he was whinier than
    Dawn's character, and that's saying something! Seriously, I just skip through
    his sections whenever I re-watch season 1 now. I'd rather listen to Dawn screeching
    \"GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!!\" several times in a row. UGH. He was just not a
    believable character to me, to put it mildly. *stabs him in the eyes with broomsticks*\r\n-----"

    screenshot of her looking sweet, lost, vulnerable, etc (sigh) / love it /
    i'm a latecomer too, currently on season six and totally sad in advance that tara
    will be gone at some point, noooo\r\n\r\nalso still feeling \"ripped off\" that
    we never got a tara/willow \"first kiss\" scene / i don't think that one
    \"sexual\" spell they did together really counts. for me.\r\n\r\nanyway, hi"

<p>I am a latecomer to <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, I only started watching it after <a href="http://www.five.tv/">five</a> rebroadcast the first series in March 2005. After we realised it was cut we borrowed a friend&rsquo;s box set and we were off: buying and selling video copies on eBay until we decided to buy the region 1 box-set, the <a href="http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000AQ68RI.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg">Chosen Collection</a>. We finished season 7 at the beginning of January 2006.</p>
<p>I can declare my passion for <em>BtVS</em> from the Oz/Willow/Tara arc of season four when I became smitten with the latter two. I can safely say that the ending of "Seeing<em> </em>Red" broke the part of my heart that loved <em>BtVS</em> and season 7 would have had to be brilliant to compensate for the loss of Tara (and the luminous Amber Benson). And season 7 wasn&rsquo;t brilliant&hellip;</p>
