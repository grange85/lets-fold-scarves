  content: Hazel, glad to see you're still obsessing about Buffy. Did you follow Nikki
    Stafford's "great Buffy rewatch" last year? I enjoyed it immensely. If there is
    anything better than a rewatch, it's rewatching with people who have a similar
    passion for the show. I miss it again already.

  content: Hi Page 48, Oh yes, still obsessing about <em>Buffy</em> over here.
    My rewatch and re-write started with Nikki Stafford but we got sort of left behind.
    If wasn't for my pesky family, I would have kept up!

Their idea of a rite of passage doesn't bear too much scrutiny. So hand wave, hand wave, because the mythology of <em>Buffy</em> is not the reason I watch it. So if we hand wave Giles' behaviour and betrayal then we have a great story about what lengths an "ordinary" person will go to save her kidnapped mother. Sarah Michelle Gellar is excellent as usual while Anthony Head is rather fine but it is Jeff Kober who has the most fun.</p>
