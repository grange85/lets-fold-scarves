<p><img src="https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/19/1000.jpg" />I&rsquo;m not really happy with my Hitchcock project. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m saying anything interesting! When I did my <em>Buffy</em> posts, I&rsquo;d rewatch the episode and read the transcripts and look at the screencaps that people had made and then got to work. Basically I put some effort into it (even if the quality of the effort is debatable). However, considering how long it has taken Andy and I to get this far I&rsquo;m not starting again so from the next film I&rsquo;ll be better.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Secret Agent</em> ages ago so this is going to be even poorer than usual.</p>
<p>It is tempting to see more to this film but really it is just a potboiler with little depth.</p>
<p>John Gielgud - considering the man&rsquo;s considerable stage actor, he had very little presence on screen - he was simply pleasant at best.</p>
<p>Madeleine Carroll - she was okay but her role was terrible - very few Hitchcock heroines are so useless - she didn&rsquo;t use her wits or even her wiles - dull!</p>
<p>Peter Lorre - he was so creepy and not just in an intentional manner. Robert Young was also creepy - just take your hands off her!</p>
<p>Honestly, if it was not a Hitchcock, it&rsquo;d be long forgotten.</p>
