<p>We have always loved Nova Pilbeam in this film and we named a cat after her.</p>

<p>I think we should name any dog we have Towser.</p>

<p>This is an enjoyable romp of a film but at the same I can&rsquo;t think of any other British Hitchcock film that has as much resemblance to real life as this does. It actually unwittingly tells us quite a lot about mid-thirties Britain.</p>
<p>A Britain in which an obviously bright girl was clearly not destined for university or a job but was heading straight into marriage. One where said young woman may be in charge of the household but she has a maid and a cook to ensure that all she has to worry about is the film&rsquo;s plot.</p>

<p>Cars were still being started with cranks and there were still plenty of horse drawn vehicles about.</p>

<p>Petrol stations weren&rsquo;t really stations but places where little boys would operate the single pump for you (perhaps this was a Hitchcock touch but you can imagine him witnessing this and noting it down for later use).</p>

<p>Roadside cafes were called carmen&rsquo;s shelters and lorry drivers were called carmen.</p>

<p>And you could get huge mugs of tea there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0445.jpg"   /></p>
<p>A Britain with lots of smoking and very fancy party hats.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0569.jpg"   /></p>
<p>And perhaps more damning, a Britain with tramps and dosshouses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0712.jpg"   /></p>
<p>And less damning, a Britain where broken china wasn&rsquo;t thrown away but was mended.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://the.hitchcock.zone/1000/21/0731.jpg"   /></p>
<p>And finally, a Britain where bands played live in hotels in blackface (any good reason for that?)</p>
