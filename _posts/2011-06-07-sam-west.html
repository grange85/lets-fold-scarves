<p>Half watching a documentary on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011g7g2">Wilson/Heath rivalry</a>. Chock full of ancient politicians including a very old and different looking Denis Healey and the evergreen Shirley Williams who hasn't aged in decades - that must be the advantage of not giving a toss about your appearance. One of the odd things about it, is that it is narrated by Samuel West who played Ted Heath in the fabulous <i>The Long Walk to Finchley</i>. He was hilarious in that.</p>
<p>I follow him on Twitter: he has a rather unusual handle for someone you might assume to be a self publicist. He is funny, a die-hard lefty and a twitcher: @exitthelemming</p>
