_Saboteur_ is a thoroughly likeable thriller with charming leads. It’s like a cross between The _39 Steps_ and _North by Northwest_ and there are several set pieces that wouldn’t be out of place in any of Hitchcock’s best films.

The brightly lit sunny scene at the ranch with sweet Susie and her suavely sinister grandfather played by Otto Kruger.

The circus caravan sequence is beautifully written with lovely engaging characters.

I love scenes set in ghost towns. Perhaps they are romantic because they are a rarity in the UK. The scene in the office reminded me of a point and click adventure as they locate the tripod and the telescope.

The finale at the Statue of Liberty is brilliant and very exciting (though as has been pointed out it really should be the hero hanging by a thread not the villain).

Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane were lovely and fresh and an age appropriate couple.
