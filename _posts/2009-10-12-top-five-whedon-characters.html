    to say Oz, but he wasn't really around for very long.  I like Adelle, but don't
    love her."

  content: "I know what you mean <b>saranga</b> but if I didn't like her in a
    top five way then seven seasons of <i>Buffy</i> would have been awfully hard
    work. \r\n\r\nAnd I think SMG was phenomenal."

  content: "1. Buffy\r\n2. Willow\r\n3. Mal\r\n4. River\r\n5. Adelle\r\n\r\nI'll go
    for Adelle because I think without her there is no way I'd have made it into the
    second season* and because of <a href=\"/images/uploads/2009/10/mywindow05.jpg\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">that cup of tea with November</a>.\r\n\r\nSpot five could
    have been taken by loads of others - the top 4 are probably safe in their slots.\r\n\r\n(*
    mind you all those seasons of Angel and no sign of representation in my top 5!)"

  content: "1.  Zoe -- my heart still breaks for her.\r\n2.  Willow\r\n3.  Wash/Xander
    -- really, aren't they the same?\r\n4.  Cordelia -- \"I think it, I say it.\"\r\n5.
    \ Adelle -- The most morally ambiguous character and oh the responsibilities she
    has.  \r\n\r\nAnd I agree with others about not liking Buffy so much, but what
    can you do when Whedon's longest running and best known show is named after her?"

    list:\r\n\r\n1. Willow\r\n2. Tara\r\n3. Faith\r\n4. Simon\r\n5. River\r\n\r\n(I
    do love me some Oz, but I'll bump him since he was only on <i>Buffy</i> for
    two seasons or so.)"

    watch the show the more I understand about her.  I think I am finding more things
    to sympathise with her about, the more often I watch it.'

  content: "1) Willow... Yum. \r\n2) Cordelia (in Angel mostly, but before the writers
    spiralled her into the uglyness that was season 4 >>> Instead think Episode 100
    Cordelia: sassy, smart, bitchy but full of heart)\r\n3) Giles\r\n4) Lilah\r\n5)
    Drusilla, cause who doesn't love the crazy?!\r\n\r\nPlus I <3 Amber Benson and
    she would be up there for sure except that for some reason unknown to me the writers
    refused to develop her character *frown*"
