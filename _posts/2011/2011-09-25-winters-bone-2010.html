<p>When will I learn that a film about poverty described with such adjectives as <em>chilling</em>, <em>searing</em>, <em>rawest</em>, <em>gritty</em>, <em>genuine</em>, <em>shabby</em>, <em>grimly</em> and <em>unflinching</em>, is not a film for me? </p>
<p>And I'm not sure the poor people of the Ozarks deserve their story to be told through the means of a rather dull mystery story either.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lawrence was superb but since she looks better with an axe:</p>
<p><a href="/images/uploads/2011/09/20110925-224341.jpg"><img src="/images/uploads/2011/09/20110925-224341.jpg" alt="20110925-224341.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a><br /><br /><br />
<a href="http://www.magxone.com/uploads/2010/09/Jennifer-Lawrence-Esquire-UK-3.jpg">than all greased up</a>, it's sad she's yet another young actress who didn't say no.</p>
