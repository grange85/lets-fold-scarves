<p>So, thank goodness things are coming to a head. I am not much of a romantic so I find it hard to watch (or maybe even care) about soppy Buffy and Angel (I&#39;m clearly no Willow on that front). I am also fed up with Xander and Cordelia&#39;s hate-love relationship.<br></p>
<p><br>I don&#39;t think I have ever been convinced that even a newly re-assembled, and not at full strength, Judge would be fazed by some TVs falling on him. Still, any old reason for Buffy and Angel to get caught in the rain.<br></p>
