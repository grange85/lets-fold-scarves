<p>The last act of this is pretty dire concluding with <em>Buffy</em>'s best forgotten cliffhanger.</p>
<p>Based on this, the best way to keep the young men of Sunnydale from blabbing about the demons would be to blackmail them about their virginity.</p>
<p>We were all pretty horrified when Angel took off his leather jacket to expose his white vest. Eww. However, Xander fancied him! Because he's buff!</p>
<p>The special effect when Miss French swivels her neck was surely naff in 1997?</p>
<p>If there had been a sequence of episodes as feeble as this one then I probably wouldn't be writing this blog.</p>
