  content: "Even though I watched the whole series for the first time in a 5 month
    span, beginning in the fall of 2009, I was surprised to go back to square one
    and see how young everyone looked in the early days. \r\n\r\nI was also struck
    by how much I enjoyed watching that first episode again. TV characters as friends?
    Pathetic in a way, I suppose, but I realized how much I missed these guys after
    the 6 or 8 months since I watched the finale. \r\n\r\nI look forward to reading
    the responses from the latest batch of newbies as the year rolls along to see
    if they react as favourably as I did. I have a feeling that this may be the proper
    way to watch a series like BtVS."

    days, just how <i>enjoyable</i> it is to watch? \r\n\r\nI was too struck by
    how young they look notably chipmunk cheeks SMG who, by chance, we saw much matured
    in S1 <i>Angel</i> later in the evening."

    and it's fun to get the highlights from each episode like this. Season 1 Willow

<p>We are watching <em>Buffy</em> again thanks to <a href="http://nikkistafford.blogspot.com/">Nikki Stafford</a>. And although my take is distinctly superficial (with an occasional insight), <a href="http://2maggie2.livejournal.com/22016.html">other people</a>'s observations are amazingly detailed and deep and time worthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giles's first appearance is rather campy and I love the way he drops the Vampyr volume on the counter: he is so excited to see Buffy.<br />
Angel wears a shiny jacket and did I detect a whisper of an Irish accent?<br />
Willow is cute wiping water from her face after drinking from a fountain. She wears her first awful outfit in the Bronze: that is a very furry cardy she has on.<br />
The acting is variable: all of them are a long way from comfortable but you can see sparks coming from Sarah Michelle Gellar particularly when she tells Giles she is not interested in his Vampyr book and all that goes with it and when she speaks to him after the boy is found.<br />
I like Principal Bob Flutie trying to stick Buffy's transcript back together.<br />
I do like Cordelia but it is a shame that Charisma Carpenter wasn't really young enough looking to play the role. They soon forget that she's a teenager once she gets to Los <em>Angel</em>es.<br />
Probably my favourite bit is:</p>
<p>Buffy: Uh. Hi! Willow? Right?<br />
Willow: Why? I mean, hi!</p>
