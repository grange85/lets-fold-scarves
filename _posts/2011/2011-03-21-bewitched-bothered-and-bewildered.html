<p>This is fun though I am still discomforted by the women&#39;s behaviour under this spell while at the same time I love the performances of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robia LaMorte and Kristine Sutherland while they are possessed. I am such a fan of Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia and she is great in this: I love how she manages to insult Xander even when she is doing the right thing at the end.<br></p>
