  content: I'm always amazed at how many chances Buffy has had to dust Spike and/or
    Drusilla. She could easily have staked Dru and still trapped Spike in the bomb
    shelter. I wonder if she spared Dru because of how Angel may have reacted to Dru's
    demise at the hands of his girlfriend. Would Angel have disapproved? Or is the
    Slayer just a softie?

  content: "Oh yeah, and \"whating a what?\" Buffy is so beautifully inept at reacting
    when she's startles. Like when Giles surprised her in the library when she and
    Willow went to steal the Watcher's Diary: \r\n\r\nGiles: \"Buffy\"\r\nBuffy: \"Nothing\".
    Very smooth, Buffy. Giles won't suspect at thing."

<p>I had ever really thought much of this episode (as a whole) before but this time I was gripped.</p>
<p>The scene when Angel tells Buffy about his relationship with Drusilla was well written and acted but was marred by the choice to shoot SMG (wearing an unflattering off the shoulder top) from an high angle. I mean, look!</p>
<p><img title="buffy303.jpg" src="/images/uploads/2011/02/buffy3031.jpg" alt="buffy303.jpg" /></p>
<p>Buffy misses another chance to kill Spike and Drusilla when she (and the others) fail to take advantage of the fact that they ARE TRAPPED IN A BOMB SHELTER and, as such, are sitting ducks.</p>
<p>Still, it's a pretty solid episode. It has a Divinyls reference and begins the story of Anne: I love that she returns. I like it when Angel visits Willow in her room. He looks rather scrummy with a more Goth like look than usual.</p>
<p>Finally: &ldquo;What? Whating a what?&rdquo;</p>
