    Now, now, the Angel background is necessary so that his death next episode has the requisite punch.  This our last chance to learn about the mystery guy, let's fill in those details while we can.

    (What? He comes back?  Buffy wastes the entire next season pining over him?  Yeah, righhhhht.  C'mon, now.)

    It is technically interesting to see David B play *six* separate characters (Liam, Angelus v. 1, resouled blubbering Angel, Stink Guy, Heroic Angel, Angelus v.2) when he used to struggle to play one, we get great Scooby friendship scenes and the Best Scooby Fight Ever, great heroics from Xander and great snark from Spike.  And an absolutely great climax/cliffhanger.

    If I didn't thoroughly hate Max Perlich (and, to be fair, the whole deus-ex-machina that Whistler is), I'd really love this one.  Still pretty good, though.

<p>Why is Willow still teaching? I know nothing about the US education system but it doesn&#39;t seem particularly <i>likely</i>.<br><br>This episode tells us all about Angel and that is as interesting as that sounds.<br><br></p>
<p>Buffy falls for an old trick and as a result Kendra dies. That&#39;s going to cause Buffy some mental anguish.<br><br>There is something deepy icky about Buffy sucking on that lollipop.<br><br>
