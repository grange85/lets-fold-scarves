<p>I swear there was more of Clea DuVall in this. She&#39;s the main reason I like this episode along with the brilliant Cordelia character development. <br><br>It has a very <i>X-Files</i> ending which I didn&#39;t mind but I&#39;m glad they stayed away from that. After all government involvement in this series would just kill it, wouldn&#39;t it? Erm.<br></p>
<p><br>Just how did Marcie transport Cordelia and Buffy to the Bronze: invisibility <i>and</i> super-strength? No wonder the government is interested.<br><br>

<div style="text-align: left;">(I didn&#39;t like the ending in 2006 but now I don&#39;t mind. However, in general, I am struck by how consistent my thoughts on the episodes were back then compared with my thoughts now. Consistent or boring?)<br></p>
