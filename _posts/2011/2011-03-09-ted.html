<p>I don't know why this provokes such negativity with a lot of fans. I totally agree that it ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily - I mean where do people think Ted has gone to? - shouldn't Joyce be scared he might come back?</p>
<p>I do understand that it may not deal with the full implications of what Buffy did: she lost her temper and killed a man: it makes no difference that it transpires that he was not one: she did not know this. I, nevertheless, think it does a damn fine job bearing in mind that <em>Buffy</em> - the series - is not in full swing yet. Neither "Lie To Me" or "The Dark Age" or anything before "Innocence"&nbsp; dealt adequately with the issues they raised.</p>
<p>The killing of a human and the subsequent effect it has on the character is fully realised in Faith and that took the rest of <em>Buffy</em> from S3 and some of <em>Angel</em>.</p>
<p>However, John Ritter is fantastic as the eponymous character - he nails all aspects of his personality and does a great head jerk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Watch out for that frying pan, Ted!</p></p>
