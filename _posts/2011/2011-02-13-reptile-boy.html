  content: There isn't any reason for Buffy wanting to die when Angel kisses her.
    It's so early in their relationship at this point that she doesn't deserve to
    drop a line like that on unsuspecting viewers.

<p>I really hate the main storyline. I know that unpleasant frat boys and the torture and humiliation of others is a staple of horror but I don&#39;t like watching it.<br><br>I do like the gang watching a Bollywood film; Cordelia&#39;s fake laugh; Buffy besting Giles in combat and in pouting; Willow apparent jealousy of Buffy going out with Cordelia; Willow having a go at Giles and Angel; and this exchange:<br></p>
<p><br><br />

<p></blockquote><br>Why does Buffy want to die when Angel kisses her? Why doesn&#39;t this romance do anything for me at this point in the series? Why do I cringe every time Willow asks Buffy about her love life?<br><br>
