<p>&nbsp;I like Kendra, her accent is broad but doesn&#39;t sound unbelievable to me, and, I don&#39;t care, I love the "it&#39;s me only shirt" line.<br><br>I don&#39;t like her shyness around Xander because its doesn&#39;t suit her persona as represented by her make-up and revealing clothes.<br></p>
<p> <br>I think her closing words to Buffy are lovely ("You talk about slaying like it&#39;s a job. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s who you are." and I don&#39;t hug either.<br><br>Xander and Cordelia coming together is certainly an interesting development. And Oz and Willow are chatting and they are so cute.<br></p>
