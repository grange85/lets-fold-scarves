  content: I came across your blog doing a search for Paula Frazer and trying to find
    out any news about tours. I loved the Tarnation stuff and her own solo work, it
    just seems she was way ahead of her time in the late 90s when the popular press
    were absorbed with Brit Pop and Oasis and Blur. Now 'Alt-Country' (if that's what
    it has to be called!) pretty much has festivals dedicated to it, and Paula's should
    be headlining, but she's not even on a bill or a venue anywhere. It's not quite
    right is it?

  content: "I agree, it's a travesty that she isn't a star. Sh has a fantastic voice
    and a knack for writing catchy and appealing songs. \r\n\r\nThe first time I heard
    (of) her was live on Tom Robinson's show on 6Music while she was on tour but obliviously
    I missed that. She was supposed to come to the UK again but the tour was cancelled.
    Since then she has come to Europe but the closest place to me was Belgium and
    I was very tempted to go there just to see her. Heck, I was even tempted to go
    to Barcelona. \r\n\r\nShe is also performing as <a href=\"http://www.signalandnoise.com/2011/03/skystone/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Skystone</a> so maybe being part of a band may aid any tour
    plans for the UK."
