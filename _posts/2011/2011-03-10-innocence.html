<p>What is bad about this episode? Erm, either the line "and wear something trashy...er" or the costuming that doesn&#39;t match the line (she&#39;s wearing a twin-set for heaven&#39;s sake) or the continual characterisation of Cordelia as slutty (or at least being slutty in appearance) when, if we must sling mud, Buffy&#39;s outfits are much much worse - witness the spaghetti strap top she wears when she attacks Jenny in the classroom for a start. Actually, it is clearly all three points, it&#39;s nasty and not a little misogynistic which seems a weird thing to write.<br></p>
<p><br>Otherwise, brilliant. Even Buffy&#39;s inability to kill Angel which makes her answerable for many deaths (notably Jenny&#39;s) is interesting.<br><br>
