  content: "\"If you don't get Buffy after viewing \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\" and
    \"The Harvest\", I'm surprised if you get Buffy at all.\"\r\n\r\nAgreed. When
    you've got a show with the well deserved reputation of BtVS, why would anyone
    not want to start watching at the beginning?"

<p>I&#39;m puzzled that some people recommend that <i>Buffy</i> virgins should skip S1 and start with S2. It&#39;s not as if S2 doesn&#39;t have a good selection of clunkers and, in order to get episodes as good as "Innocence" and "Passion", you need to develop the characters and plotlines; you need to have earned the right to break our hearts.<br></p>
<p> <br>If you don&#39;t get <i>Buffy</i> after viewing "Welcome to the Hellmouth" and "The Harvest", I&#39;m surprised if you get <i>Buffy</i> at all. <br><br>"Nightmares" is great. That is all.<br></p>
