<p>This may be the first 18 certificate film I saw at the cinema. I wonder at what cinema I saw it but I can't remember that because it was nearly thirty years ago. It's remarkable just how much I recalled despite not seeing it since. It's clear that the film meant more to me then than it does now, after all I was closer to adolescence way back then, because rewatching it was disappointing. It is very well made, the acting effective, the atmosphere creepy, the effects are great, the dogs/wolves are mostly believeable but the themes just didn't resonate in the same way.</p>
<p>The part that remembered most clearly was the transformation of Stephen Rea's character from man to wolf. It was the most gruesome and repulsive things I had ever seen on screen. And it remains one of the most gruesome and repulsive things I have ever seen too, partly because it scarred me for life and I avoid gore wherever possible, and partly because it <em>is</em> revolting.</p>
<p>Sarah Patterson made two films in the early 80s before she presumably furthered her education. She has appeared in a couple of films in the noughties directed by Lisa Gornick and here she is as a photographer in <em>Tick Tock Lullaby</em>:<br />
