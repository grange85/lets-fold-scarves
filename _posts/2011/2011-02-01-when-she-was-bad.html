  content: "This episode is one of the few on which we have divergent opinions, Hazel.
    I actually consider \"When She Was Bad\" one of the best episodes of the series
    -- it's at least one of my favorites. \r\n<blockquote>Mr Whedon, and the plot
    doesn't work; it's just unsatisfactory.</blockquote>\r\nWell, what do you
    expect? Joss wrote the episode. Joss doesn't do well with plot. He does great
    dialogue or high concept, but it's a rare, rare day when he nails a good plot.
    \r\n\r\nI wrote <a href=\"http://thistosay.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-when-she-was-bad\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">a whole post</a> on this episode over at my blog but feel
    free to respond to it here if you want. :-)"

  content: "You may be right about Joss and his plots. In fact, you are when you consider
    \"Amends\" and \"Family\" but episodes like \"Doppelgangland\", \"Hush\", \"Who
    Are You?\" and \"Once More, With Feeling\" are endlessly watchable while this
    just isn't.\r\n\r\nIt is full of great stuff to be sure but, ultimately, I don't
    care enough about anybody's predicament to thoroughly enjoy the episode."

  content: "I love Principal Snyder. Some people seem to be particularly fond of his
    predecessor, but I think Snyder has some seriously funny moments, including \"talking
    to himself\", and, IMO,  he is the principal of record when it comes to BtVS.\r\n\r\nBuffy
    and Xander love to take turns at treating each other like crap.  In a dangerous
    world where either of them could die 2 seconds later, they both risk leaving each
    other with potentially very nasty last words. A little respect, guys. Surely this
    isn't what they taught you in Scooby School."

<p>How do you follow up a superb S1 finale and kick off the new season? The answer is not very well. This has classic dialogue (one of the best lines ever "It&#39;s entirely pointy!"), a literally sweet scene with Willow and Xander at the beginning of the programme, one of Buffy&#39;s best dreams (astute viewers will spot the wrong snacks being eaten by Xander and Willow), a great Cordelia and Buffy scene, Principal Snyder being all Principal Snydery, and the cast is strung up like pigs but it doesn&#39;t hang together. <br></p>
<p><br>The dirty dancing with Xander is plain icky and a not a little pervy, Mr Whedon, and the plot doesn&#39;t work; it&#39;s just unsatisfactory.<br><br>However, Adam predicted that Andy and I had smiles on our face at the conclusion of the episode and, of course, he was right.<br></p>
