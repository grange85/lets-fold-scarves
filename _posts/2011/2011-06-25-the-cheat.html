<p>They don't make them like this any more. Times have moved on and what was shocking and exciting and <em>other</em>, simply isn't anymore. We just don't need steamy, overwrought melodramas like this.</p>
<p>It is a period piece but didn't feel outrageously dated. It wasn't at all horrible to watch because the acting was natural and unstilted, and the camerawork wasn't static. It only really felt old because the story was so blooming ancient. The best performance was from Tallulah Bankhead and there were some unusual outdoor scenes: these <a href="http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70718/The-Cheat/notes.html">location shots</a> did ensure it felt different on that front from most Hollywood productions of the thirties.</p>

<p>By the way, I think I'm going to enjoy spending time at TCMdb.</p>
