<p>I don&#39;t care what many people think because in this instance, I simply don&#39;t care about the derivative story. It&#39;s not that bad and it doesn&#39;t get in the way of the fact that the dialogue in this episode is on fire; there are loads of great lines brilliantly delivered. <br></p>
<p><br>In addition: Buffy wears dark glasses and a trenchcoat; Xander falls off a fence; Giles and Ms Calendar have instant chemistry; it&#39;s Ms Calendar&#39;s debut and Robia LaMorte is perfect, Angel isn&#39;t in it; Willow wields a fire extinguisher; you feel sorry that Dave is murdered; and it ends with the Scoobies fearing for their chance for happy, normal relationships.<br></p>
