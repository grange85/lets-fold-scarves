  content: "I like Oz and Tara both, but I could never buy into Willow and Tara as
    a couple (much less Willow and that awful Kennedy). Had Willow shown any inclination
    early on that she could swing both ways, maybe I could accept her lesbian leanings
    later on, but the way she pined over Xander and matched up so well with Oz, I
    just don't buy that she could suddenly be swayed by a shy girl with a shared interest
    in witchery. \r\n\r\nThat said, I loved Tara (and Amber), perhaps no more so than
    in \"Family\", when she had me weeping like a baby when it looked like her whole
    world was about to implode and she would have to go back with her creepy family.
    Then, Buffy and the hair puller to the rescue in one of my favourite scenes in
    the series."

  content: "I'm happy with Willow's change of direction. After all, the Giles of S1
    \ shocks and amazes us when he is revealed as the man who was Ripper. People in
    the Buffyverse are constantly surprising us with unexpected aspects to their characters.\r\n\r\nAnd
    in my own experience, I know people who would have identified as straight until
    they developed self awareness and realised what they had hitherto not even acknowledged
    to themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, I could have done without the \"gay now\" comments
    because they bugged me: <i>Buffy</i> is not a black and white world."

  content: "I actually think that Willow's love life bears up well when scrutinized
    for hints that she might be gay. And Willow seemed to identify as a <b>lesbian</b>,
    not a bisexual woman, even though the writers never really wanted to go into the
    complexity of queer identity later in the show. \r\n\r\nThe biggest hint comes
    in \"Doppelgangland\" when Willow observes that Vamp Willow is \"so evil. And
    skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay.\" Buffy tries to assure Willow that the vampire
    versions of people do not resemble who they were in life, which causes Angel to
    say \"Actually--\" But then he stops himself and agrees with Buffy when he sees
    the girls' faces.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show and well through the third
    season, Willow crushes on Xander, whom she knows is not interested in her. It's
    actually not uncommon at all from accounts I've heard from various people for
    those who later come out as queer to have such a crush on opposite-sex best friends
    and other unattainable people. It allows people to, even unconsciously, perform
    the heterosexuality without having to engage in heterosexual romantic activities
    with which they might not feel too comfortable. \r\n\r\nAlso, the physical side
    Oz and Willow's relationship progressed very slowly and was never a big part of
    their relationship, which was built more on mutual caring and affection. I'm not
    trying to say that straight couples cannot have relationships that look like Willow
    and Oz's, but even Joss cites the downplayed sexual aspect of their relationship
    as a retconned \"hint\" that Willow might be gay in one of the episode commentaries,
    I forget which one.\r\n\r\nFinally, just because a someone eventually realizes
    that they prefer being in same-sex relationships, it doesn't mean that they were
    necessarily unhappy in their opposite-sex relationships. Some people do articulate
    that they were never attracted to the opposite sex or that they \"felt something
    was missing\" in their heterosexual relationships. However, I'm currently lying
    next to a woman who was with a man for 12 years and never felt either of those
    things, but now very firmly identifies as a lesbian. \r\n\r\nIt's fine if you
    \"couldn't see\" Willow as gay or didn't think there were enough hints that she
    was because there weren't. Willow was not conceived as a queer character. However,
    I think sexuality is always more complicated than we would prefer."

  content: Yes, Willow wasn't conceived as gay but, based on my own experiences and
    what many people say, I can totally believe she is going to be gay at this point
    in the series. It's amazing that the show can stand up to such scrutiny and is
    one of the reasons I love it so much.

  content: "Well, I'll be the first to admit that, even in real life, I often can't
    see what's right in front of me, so to even question Willow's sexual preference
    at the 2.12 mark of BtVS is not on my radar. \r\n\r\nHowever,  since she is not
    so much with the timber now, I still greatly prefer her with Tara than with Kennedy,
    I guess because I just adore Tara, but wish I'd never met Kennedy (or the other
    Potentials for that matter).  Hell, I'd rather see Willow wind up a lonely spinster
    than to see her settle for Kennedy, who I view as being several rungs down from
    either Oz or Tara."

  content: "Ah, the perils of retrospective viewing: in the olden days we would have
    watched it once when it went out (assuming you didn't record it on your VCR) and
    then had to wait a week (or more) before the next episode: it wasn't made for
    close viewing.\r\n\r\nI think we all three quite probably agree that we wish we
    had never met Kennedy and any other Potential ;-)"

<p>Oz! <br><br>Well, I like Oz but I like Tara. But which is better? Oz or Tara? There&#39;s only one way to find out...<br><br>Tara is the reason I love <i>Buffy</i> but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t like the character of Oz. He was so cool. And he had taste.<br></p>
<p> <br>I&#39;ve always liked this episode. I think Ampata&#39;s situation is heartbreaking. The urge to live again when your life had been curtailed unjustly is a powerful one.<br><br>I like the explanation for Ampata&#39;s good English. I also like my family&#39;s explanation for the appearance of a z-bed for Ampata in Buffy&#39;s room (but was Buffy really going to share her room with a boy?): although it is later shown that the Summers live in a three bedroomed house since Dawn has a room of her own, however, just like Dawn the bedroom doesn&#39;t exist yet so a z-bed is required in this reality&#39;s two bedroomed house.<br></p>
<p><br>Willow&#39;s hats may make their first appearance but here she is as the cutest Scooby:<br><br>
