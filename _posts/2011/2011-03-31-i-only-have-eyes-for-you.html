    What, you don't like Marti Noxon's "girls, forgive your abuser" episode?  Why, it's not as though four seasons later Marti is going to write an episode where Buffy misses her rapist, wants him to babysit her virginal 15-year-old sister and pouts when she finds he's left town, right?

    Oh, wait&hellip;

    (Still enough S2 goodies to be better than anything after S4 [I think the entire Dawnverse is crap, and yes I include "Wah, Wah, Joyce is Dead" and The Stupid Musical in that indictment"] from Xander paraphrasing Shakespeare to Willow getting Giles out of his Jenny-fixation to "Nuke the school? I like it" to everything having to do with Cordelia [again, of course]&hellip;but it's still way worse than the unfairly-bashed "Killed by Death" and pretty near the bottom of the S2 pile, for me.)

<p>As I peruse <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/?cat=3">Screencap Paradise</a> (who are the best) I am reminded that sometimes Buffy&#39;s hair is rather horrible; there are unexplained occurrences that surely have nothing to do with poltergeists (snakes, wasps, etc); there is lot of emoting; Drusilla is highly irritating; and that I don&#39;t like this episode at all.<br></p>
