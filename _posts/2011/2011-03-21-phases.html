<p>The werewolf hunter wasn't exactly a nuanced villain but otherwise this was a fine episode.</p>
<p>"He-he said he was going through all these changes. Then he went through all these...changes."</p>
<p>Willow is getting more and more confident: when Giles asks if she's sure about Oz, her reply is an exasperated "Can't you just trust me on this?"</p>
<p>Buffy is upset about people dying because of her though she seems a little more put out by the thought of a werewolf doing the killing than she was by it actually being Angel.</p>
<p>Larry's coming out and Xander's reaction is hilarious.</p>
<p>This episode has one of my all time favourite Buffy lines: "I didn&rsquo;t jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were."</p>
<p>Willow has a fawn on her t-shirt! Foreshadowing!</p>
