    Not only does Cordy save their lives by running off Lyle, but she was absolutely right about the spatula being more help than the phone.  Buffy kills Candy with the spatula; all the answering machine message does is distract Giles and lead to concussion #417.

    A pity they couldn't get Jack Conley back as Cain.  (He came back several time to play Sahjahn on Angel, afterwards.)  The "Rogues Gallery" episode, a staple of comic books, loses its punch with only one familiar face challenging Buffy.  And why not at least add Ethan?  Robin Sachs was available for the next episode, put him in this one, too.  Sigh.

    Willow's photograph.  Faith asking Buffy to be her date.  The whiteboard.  Buffy tricking Scott into supporting her candidacy.  Xander's reason for helping Cordelia ("She's my girlfriend"&hellip;rather presumptuous, weren't you, Buff?) and the sweetness of the W/X kiss are lovely.  The "fluke" retconning of their real feelings, however, is ridiculous.

    And Buffy can stop lying to her friends about Angel any time now&hellip;please?

    (Also, getting the Grulenstahlers to shoot each is contrived and unnecessary.  Throw the tracer in a trash can and get the jump on them, no big.)
