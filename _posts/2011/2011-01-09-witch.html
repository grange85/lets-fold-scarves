<p>Apparently this is called "Witch" and not "The Witch", well, well.</p>
<p>Despite not knowing its true title for so long, nevertheless this is definitely one of my favourite S1/S2 episodes: an excellent MOTW episode. However, the weakness of episodic series is exposed when you consider that not one character mentions Jesse. Willow and Xander's best friend is forgotten that quickly?</p>
<p>Anyway, I love the fakeout telling off that Giles gave Buffy in her cheerleader uniform. Perky Buffy singing "Macho Man" is a <em>Buffy</em> highlight.</p>
<p>Buffy comes extremely close to death and Giles truly watches out for her though I can hardly believe it's his "first casting". The show's early days are a bit off as regards future developments.</p>
<p>Buffy is rocking the retro look here. I like Amy's trousers and I like her dialogue ("Well, I know that I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling out words with my arms".) Poor Amy was such an attractive character until she became a rat.</p>
