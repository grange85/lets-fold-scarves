<p>I don&#39;t really have much to say about this. I&#39;d be happy never to see it again but on the other hand it has loads of great Cordelia moments from banging on about Buffy&#39;s thing on her face to annoying Giles while doing research and saying one of my favourite lines: "Tact is just not saying true stuff. I&#39;ll pass." so if I was obsessed with Charisma Carpenter &nbsp;it would be great!<br></p>
<p><br>I hate the attitude of the Scoobies at the end, just who do Xander and Willow think they are to behave like that to Joyce?<br><br>
