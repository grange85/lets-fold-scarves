<p>The Gorches! They burn!<br><br>This isn&#39;t really that bad. It&#39;s just not that good.<br><br>Highlights include the immortal words: "You boiled your young?" and the exchange: "Can I just say gyughhh!" "I see your &#39;gyughhh!&#39; and raise you a nyaghhh!"<br></p>
<p><br>It also suffers in retrospect because when you know it precedes "Surprise/"Innocence", I&#39;m sure many people can&#39;t help thinking something along the lines of "from the ridiculous to the sublime."<br></p>
