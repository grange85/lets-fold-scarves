<p>Faith is such a dynamic character: the energy level of the show shoots up when she is on screen. Angel does the opposite for me and mine: Adam can hardly wait for him to get his own series.<br><br>I did like Trick&#39;s meta-commentary about the whiteness of Sunnydale: it&#39;s a pity nothing was really done about it though.<br></p>
<p><br>Scott Hope was actually rather cute but so, so, not suitable for Buffy.<br><br>And one of my favourite quotes from <i>Buffy</i>:<br><br><br />
<blockquote>The girl&rsquo;s not playing with a full deck, Giles. She has almost no deck. She has a three.<br></p>
<p></blockquote><br>
