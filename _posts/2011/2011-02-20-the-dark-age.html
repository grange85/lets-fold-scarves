<p>Poor Jenny, she thought she was the only one with a big secret. No wonder, she&#39;s having problems coping after the revelations about Rupert and a spot of being possessed by a murderous demon.<br><br>Jenny is sweet teasing Giles but their romance playing out in the hallways of the high school is most unprofessional.<br></p>
<p><br>Cordelia taking Ethan down is a highlight: as is her presence in many scenes.<br><br>I guess they made the library cage gate a little stronger for when Oz took refuge in there.<br><br>Heh, Ethan, you are droll: "Now, this may sting a little just at first. But don&#39;t worry, that&#39;ll go away once the searing pain kicks in."<br></p>
<p><br>Willow&#39;s plan to kick out the demon is a very clever one: Willow really is very smart.<br><br>The Bay City Rollers! I really, really don&#39;t think so. For on, Giles is too old and for another, he is the wrong sex.<br></p>
