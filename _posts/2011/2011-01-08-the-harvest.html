<p>I would have liked to have seen Luke again in some of the Buffy/Angel flashbacks. I'm sure he would have been a good adversary/chum for Angel or Spike. Also, his relationship with Darla could have been explored.</p>
<p>Talking of Darla, boy, did she have a character reinvention! One to match Anya's.</p>
<p>Buffy does a lot of fancy stuff in this that she never does again: jumping over fences, back flipping onto pool tables: that kind of thing. Buffy's (or should I say Sarah Michelle Gellar's) fighting poses got a lot more convincing as time went on.</p>
<p>The trick that Buffy plays on the wily Luke seems an unlikely one for such a survivor to fall for but it was very funny.</p>
<p>Willow's deliver/delete trick shows an interesting side to the mainly drippy one we see at first.</p>
<p>It's early days but Xander's toadstool shirt may be his worst shirt in the entire run.</p>
