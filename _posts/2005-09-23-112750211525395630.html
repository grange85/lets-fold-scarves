<p>The BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">Listen Again </a>is a boon. I spend my day at work, headphones on, alternating between CDs and radio programmes. I had meant to listen to Gideon Coe on 6 Music on Wednesday to hear Kate Bush's new single but completely forgot but thanks to the internet I was there today waiting with bated breath forwarding fifteen minutes at a time. The single is called King of the Mountain and is a continuation of her sound from The Red Shoes. It doesn't quite seem worth the very long wait but she clearly has a life well beyond music. I suspect it's a grower but I also suspect there will be better songs on the album. She is not a singles artist really - There Goes a Tenner, anyone?</p>
