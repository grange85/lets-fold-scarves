<p>The words Mornington Crescent generally make me cringe, and maybe that's why I have never visited the area before.</p>
<p>The Carreras factory was completed in 1928 and made cigarettes. It is now is the home of the British Heart Foundation.</p>

<p>I loved the repeated black cat heads. Some had poo on their foreheads but this one didn't.</p>

<p>The star attraction are the Bastet cats guarding the entrance. They are cool.</p>

<p>The building even looks great around the back which really is Mornington Crescent.</p>
