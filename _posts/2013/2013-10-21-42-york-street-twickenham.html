  content: If you follow the upper frieze (with the faces) round to the end of the
    York Street frontage there is a modern image of a man's face with someone behind
    him looking over his shoulder. You can see it clearly on Google Street View. Quite
    unusual - there is obviously a backstory to it, but what? I am intrigued.

    So there is. Very intriguing. There is also another face on Arragon Road which Google has recognised as a face and has pixellated out. Looking at the building again, I am struck by just how much effort was put into decorating it.

    Thanks for commenting!

  content: I can confirm this building was owned by South Eastern Electricity Board.
    The company moved out about 1980 . I think the featured face's are famous electrical
    engineers.  Watt , Ohm , Faraday. This building contained office's for Mains Engineering
    and Network Drawing Office. Hope this helped. Iain.

  content: Thanks Iain, that was really interesting particularly about the electrical
    engineers.

<p>This magnificent building on the corner of York Street and Arragon Road in Twickenham has a surprisingly poor internet trail. Our first thought was that it might have been a telephone exchange but I rejected that because it isn't ugly enough* (or at all really).</p>
<p><br />
Further inspection revealed some really lovely reliefs depicting electricity which means I am inclined to accept Edith's <a href="http://edithsstreets.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/river-crane-twickenham_2859.html">assertion</a> (on the rather good Edith's Streets blog) that it used to belong to the South Eastern Electricity Board. It definitely now belongs to Richmond upon Thames Council.<br />
</p>
<p>*I have never seen an attractive telephone exchange. (Any exceptions gratefully received.)</p>
