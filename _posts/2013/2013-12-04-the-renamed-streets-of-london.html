<p>Walking around Primrose Hill in the former borough of St Pancras I came across this lovely example of a renamed street which naturally made me ask why would you do that?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rayment.info/general/road_name_changes/14_1_Introduction.html">This fascinating article about fireman Fred Rayment explains all</a>: essentially London County Council found itself with too many streets with the same name so decided to rename them. </p>

<p>ETA: Actually, there is a bit more to the name changing than the London County Council which you can read about <a href="http://maps.thehunthouse.com/Streets/Street_Name_Changes.htm">here</a>.</p>
