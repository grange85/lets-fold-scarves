<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="http://www.halbweltkultur.com/">Halbwelt Kultur</a> at the Jermyn Street Theatre but I was disappointed by the lack of information about the women portrayed by the seven fine performers. The official website mentions who plays who but there isn't any biographical detail. So I thought I would pull together a decent link for each of them along with a photograph.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=365">Anita Berber</a> was a dancer and drug addict who died aged 29.</p>

<p><a href="http://lastgoddess.blogspot.co.uk/">Marlene Dietrich</a> was an actress and a bit of a legend.</p>
