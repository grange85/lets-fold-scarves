<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em></strong><strong> "Marriage of Figaro"</strong></p>
<p>A relatively undramatic episode but we learned some interesting snippets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don may be a Dick (actually we discover when he does the dirty on his daughter during her party that he is definitely a dick).</li>
<li>Pete was quite likeable but I suspect that won't last.</li>
<li>Betty is a nice person who doesn't indulge in the dissing of Helen (and she did invite the divorcee over after all) and went to Bryn Mawr which goes a long way to explaining why she can't pull her rubber gloves off.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Is this the last of Rachel? Or will she succumb to the Don charm? I hope not even though I like her character and Maggie Siff in the part.</p>
<p>The Chinese people in the office joke seemed flat both on screen and in my reaction to it. I don't really get it. Though I did enjoy Rachel negotiating the chicken as she leaves the office.</p>
<p>I thought the <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover</em> scene was very funny with great delivery of the "there's a few good parts, that's all..." line by Christina Hendricks.</p>
<p>It is notable that the most attractive characters are the most modern so I liked Helen.</p>
<p>It meandered to a close with Don's moping not particularly gripping me.</p>
<p>Not, I suspect, anyone's favourite episode and hopefully the worst.</p>
