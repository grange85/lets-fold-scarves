<p>In 2008 I took a daily photograph of Studley Grange Road uphill and downhill from the middle of the road outside my house. The intention was to create sequences over the year showing how things changed (or stayed the same) over the year. However I never got round to making them which is something I ought to get round to, ought I not?</p>
