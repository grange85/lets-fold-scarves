<p>This slogan adorned South Hanwell Baptist Church on Boston Road for years. It was replaced recently by a simple sign stating the name of the church and its website. This is better. And it means so many different things: <em>Know Jesus Know Life</em> or <em>No Jesus No Life</em> or <em>Know Jesus No Life</em> or <em>No Jesus Know Life</em>.</p>
