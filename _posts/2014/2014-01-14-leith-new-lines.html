<p>Leith has had in its past rather a lot of railway lines all of which are defunct. However, the evidence of them is everywhere. <a href="http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Leith_New_Lines/index.php">Leith New Lines by the Caledonian Railway</a> is an example of how much money there was to waste in the late Victorian era. Three passenger stations were built but none were opened! I think that is amazing. The best remaining evidence is at the foot of Leith Walk along Jane Street and Manderston Street where you can get good views of the viaduct and the abutments.</p>
