<p>I took this photograph in 2008 and it has been downhill from then. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/property/house-and-home/are-britains-empty-homes-doomed-to-dereliction-2088067.html">This is a very interesting article in the Independent from 2010</a> in which we are told the then current (still?) owners of the house tried to sell it for &pound;550,000. I don't care how historic the building is you are not likely to get a buyer at that price for a building we are told needs all the walls rebuilt and "is beyond repair".</p>
