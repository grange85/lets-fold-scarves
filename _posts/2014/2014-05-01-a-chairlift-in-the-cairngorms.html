<p>I'm rather taken by this shot. I'm not much of a photographer in the sense that I lack technical knowledge but sometimes I look at one of my photos and think that's pretty good. I like the clouds here, I like the balance of the elements, I like the contrast between the blue and brown, and finally I like that hut.</p>
