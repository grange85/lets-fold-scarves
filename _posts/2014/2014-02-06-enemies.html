<p><img alt="" src="http://media.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/buffy/buffy-enemies-0554.jpg"   /> Cordelia waiting for me to blog about "Enemies". It won't be worth waking up for.</p>
<p>It has been over a year since I last wrote about a <em>Buffy</em> episode. A year since I last watched one. Shocking.</p>
<p>I wrote about "Doppelgangland" and then we watched "Enemies" and I didn't write about it. So imagine something like blah, blah Angel is bad, blah, blah Faith is damaged and blah, blah Buffy is sad.</p>
