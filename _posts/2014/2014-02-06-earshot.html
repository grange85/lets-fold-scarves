<p>Danny Strong is great. Somehow, seeing Jonathan in full-on pity me mode, it is rather wonderful to think of Danny's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834960/reference#writer">great success as a scriptwriter</a>.</p>
<p>Now, was it in the original script to have the misdirection so blatant? A telescopic sight to shoot yourself? Well, I know you are only "three foot tall" but you aren't really that tiny, Jonathan.</p>
<p>This becomes a very funny episode as Buffy's mind reading kicks in and the Scooby gang get interrogating. And nothing is much funnier than Buffy shouting "Twice?" at her mother's swiftly disappearing back. Except maybe Giles walking into a tree.</p>
