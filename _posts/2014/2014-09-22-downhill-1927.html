<p>This was certainly downhill after The Lodger. I wonder what audiences of the era thought looking at Ivor Novello failing to look remotely like a youngster. A horrible story that didn&rsquo;t even bother to give Mabel a clear motive apart from being a rotten woman. No amount of nifty directorial flourishes can drag this from near the bottom of the Hitchcock pile.</p>
<p>Alma fact: not credited but unlikely not to be involved<br />
Appearance by a cat or dog: one cat<br />
Trains: none but there is a lengthy sequence on a boat<br />
