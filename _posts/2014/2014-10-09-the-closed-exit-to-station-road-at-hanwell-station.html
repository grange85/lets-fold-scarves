  content: "[&#8230;] The new old entrance to Hanwell station on Station Approach.
    For years this entrance was closed which was thoroughly annoying for those of
    us who live in south Hanwell. It&#8217;s amazing how much difference it makes
    when you have a train to catch. It also improves the interior. [&#8230;]"

<p>Oh, the irony of the entrance to Hanwell Station from <em>Station Approach</em> being blocked up for years has always been clear. Anyway, they are in the process of reopening it for which everybody in south Hanwell says hooray.</p>
