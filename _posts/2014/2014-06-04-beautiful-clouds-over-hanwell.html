<p>Around about eight in the evening the light outside became a lovely golden colour. I went upstairs to look out my bedroom window expecting to see a rainbow but instead I saw these beautiful skies. It was raining but instead of a rainbow I saw these gorgeous contrasts between the rain clouds and the blue sky beyond.</p>
