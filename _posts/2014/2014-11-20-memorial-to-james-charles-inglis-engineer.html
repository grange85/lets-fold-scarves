<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Charles_Inglis">James Inglis was a Scottish civil engineer.</a> He was general manager of the Great Western railway and it is rather appropriate that this stylish memorial to him is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Cemetery in Hanwell in earshot of the Great Western railway itself.</p>
