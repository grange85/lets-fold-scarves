<p>Halfway up Leith Walk (or halfway down, I suppose) opposite Albert Street there is an eyesore of a remarkable standard. It is called Shrubhill House. It was built in the sixties and housed the City of Edinburgh's social work department. It has been owned by UNITE (which isn't Unite the Union but a company that provides student accommodation) since 2006 and it is a shocking example of how companies can get away with blighting an area with no apparent consequence. It reminds me of the situation in Ealing where the company Empire was allowed to demolish a fine if tatty cinema and then leave the site rotting.</p>

<p>Shrubhill House is an eyesore but on a nice sunny winter's morning to this non-resident it looked rather photogenic.</p>
