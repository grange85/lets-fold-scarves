<p>Willow is terribly clever, or at least, academically brilliant. Well, I think she is, the episode is a little unclear on this fact.</p>
<p>Wesley was right. Willow (nobody) is worth the lives of thousands. Oz had no right to make that decision.</p>
<p>This is an enjoyable but not outstanding episode though it has some nice interactions between Faith/the Mayor, Faith/Willow and Willow/Buffy.</p>

<p>Thank goodness, the character of Cordelia is moving on at last. I hate the way this "feminist" show has treated a female character in such a one dimensional and stereotypical way. </p>
