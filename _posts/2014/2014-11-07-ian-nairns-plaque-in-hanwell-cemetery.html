<p>In honour of the publication of Nairn's London, here is Ian Nairn's plaque in the City of Westminster cemetery in Hanwell. He was a passionate architectural critic who saw wonder everywhere but also despaired of what he considered shortsighted town planning. He made many programmes for the BBC and his 1972 series <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01q1km2/episodes/player">Nairn Across Britain</a> is available on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rn270">iPlayer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hore e sempre<br />
