<p>Andy and I cycled to the <a href="http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/london/">London Wetland Centre</a> at Barnes where the sun decided to grace us with its presence. That led to hives which I have never had before and I'm still itchy today. However, it was worth it because we saw some of the world's most beautiful ducks, bellowing Marsh Frogs, baby lapwings and tumbling otters.</p>
