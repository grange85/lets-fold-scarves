  content: Thanks for your comment about the Londonist Talk. I always enjoy talking
    about St Katharine's because the history is so fascinating- from the ancient hospital
    from 1148 right up to today's incredible Docks, with all its treasures for everyone
    to share. Glad you enjoyed your day.

<p>On Sunday, Andy and I went to a day of fun talks hosted by Londonist on HMS President. I particularly enjoyed the talks by Christopher West and Georgina Young on St Katharine Docks and West India Docks. I&rsquo;m sure I could have spent the whole day listening to them, they have such breadth and depth of knowledge on places that were so essential to London being such a great city. At lunch time Andy and I wandered up to Fleet Street to find a coffee shop and were understandably distracted by the old newspaper buildings.</p>

<p>Luckily for us when we were peering through the <a href="http://www.modernistbritain.co.uk/post/building/Daily+Express+Building/">Daily Express building</a> windows, the security guard reminded us that it was Open House day and that we were welcome to go it.</p>
<p>I literally gasped when I did.</p>
