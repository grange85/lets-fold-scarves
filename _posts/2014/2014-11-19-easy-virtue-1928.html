<p><em>Easy Virtue</em> was made immediately after <em>Downhill</em> with some of the same cast members but I enjoyed it a lot more.</p>
<p>I was a little unclear how we were supposed to view Larita. She didn't tell her husband that she was a divorcee which would be quite an omission at the beginning of a marriage even now. And she smoked like a chimney. There was one scene when she had a fag dangling from her mouth and she looked rather common. However, she was completely innocent of any shenanigans and so was a wronged woman. John's family weren't welcoming but maybe they weren't happy with her stinking of smoke.</p>
<p>It was refreshing that the most supportive character was someone who is usually portrayed as the bitch - the former lover.</p>
<p>I'd like to see a restored version of this if just to see the wall coverings in the dining room scenes a little better.</p>
