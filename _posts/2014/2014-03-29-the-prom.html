I assume that I will never get &ldquo;The Prom&rdquo;. There is plenty to like about it: Joyce isn&rsquo;t unreasonable, she just asks Angel to think about what he is doing with a teenage girl; Angel&rsquo;s subsequent nightmare is genuinely horrific; Cordelia&rsquo;s storyline moves along at last giving both her and Xander some nice character development; we meet Anya again (plus a lovely unsubtle chunk of exposition); and Giles gets to say &ldquo;blueberry scone&rdquo; to Wesley.</p>
<p>However, when Giles says &ldquo;I had no idea that children en masse could be gracious.&rdquo;, I think that grace and a novelty umbrella isn&rsquo;t quite a good enough gesture to thank the saviour of Sunnydale High. If I were Buffy and I found out that people knew that I was saving their lives every single night by risking my own that I would prefer something more substantial like a militia force or at least my supplies paid for.</p>
<p>Also, Buffy and Angel&rsquo;s romance? All I can say, is thank goodness he&rsquo;s off to star on his own show.</p>
