<p>I am surprised to say this but I'm relieved that this season is over. The Buffy Angel romance did absolutely nothing for me - and is responsible for the sappiest <em>BtVS</em> moments ever. And sap has to be <em>Brief Encounter</em> brilliant for me to care. Obviously it is still great television with some of the best episodes of the entire seven seasons ("The Wish", "Doppelgangland") as well as a host of fantastic moments.</p>
<p>I don't have any problem with the ropey CGI. Growing up on <em>Doctor Who</em> makes me immune to that sort of thing, really. After all, having awesome effects is pointless if your script is written by James Cameron.</p>
<p>Cor blimey, lor love a duck, I do hate it when <em>Buffy</em> ventures into British/English stereotypes - it is always excruciating - from this side of the pond anyway. Though that does remind me - Alexis Denisof's accent is excellent.</p>
<p>Lovely, lovely single shot in the hospital involving the mayor, Angel and comatose Buffy and Faith.</p>

I hate Xander so much when he is both judgemental <em>and</em> wrong. And I don't really get it either. Why is he written like that? Why don't Willow or Oz say something in Angel's defence? After all they know that he wasn't in a position to "save his own ass". It's just annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/moley75/31903355"><img class="aligncenter" title="gasp" alt="gasp" src="http://u1.ipernity.com/42/33/55/31903355.aa867a1f.500.jpg?r2" width="500" height="375" /></a></p><br />
The Buffy/Faith dream is cool. I like Joss's dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/moley75/31903353"><img class="aligncenter" title="cat" alt="cat" src="http://u1.ipernity.com/42/33/53/31903353.70a1bc7a.500.jpg?r2" width="500" height="375" /></a></p><br />
"Scream like a woman." Joss? Why? Why? Why? Why give this line to a woman who knows how strong women can be? A woman who knows how weak men can be. It's horrible and inappropriate for <em>BtVS</em>.</p>
<p>General <em>Buffy</em> and <em>Angel</em> annoyance: why does Angel not fight all the time vamped out? - particularly when all the other vampires do - and particularly when the minion vampires are always vamped out even when they are not fighting. I know the practical answer but the show should have a reason too.</p>
<p>Talking of minions, the mayor's vampires are paltry and uninteresting. I miss Mr Trick.</p>
<p>The final showdown must have looked great on paper but, in reality, with the exception of Snyder getting it, it was an bit anti-climatic. Funny that the end of part one with just the two characters was much more exciting than part two's cast of dozens.</p>
<p>Roll on season 4 and Spike and Tara!</p>
