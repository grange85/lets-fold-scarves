<p>There was great excitement in Hanwell because a steam railmotor was running for the weekend from Southall to Brentford and back just like they used to until the Brentford branch line was closed to passenger traffic in the 1920s.</p>
<h5>*Technically not in Hanwell but I was in Hanwell when I took the photograph.</h5></p>
