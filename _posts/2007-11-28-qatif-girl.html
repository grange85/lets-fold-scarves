<p>if you live in the UK please sign <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/VictimConvicted/">this petition</a> asking the Prime Minister to condemn the sentence passed against a rape victim in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p><a href="http://equalitynow.org/english/pressroom/press_releases/saudi_20071119_en.html">Equality Now</a> has some action points you can take no matter where you live. I did e-mail both the Foreign Secretary and the Saudi Ambassador to the UK but, I'm sure coincidently, both messages bounced! Maybe they have filters for the word rape.</p>
