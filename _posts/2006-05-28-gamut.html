<p>That's a good word.</p>
<p>I came across a Dorothy Parker quote I hadn't seen before - "<em>This wasn't just plain terrible, this was fancy terrible. This was terrible with raisins in it</em>." (does it date it if raisins are considered "fancy"?) - and I was reminded of a couple of my favourites:</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn "<em>ran the whole gamut of emotions from A to B</em>."</p>
<p><strong>News Item</strong>:<br />
<em>Men seldom make passes<br />
At girls who wear glasses</em></p>
<p>This is a great quote wrongly attributed to DP:</p>
<p>"<em>If you want to know what the Lord God thinks of money, just look at those to whom he gives it</em>." - it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Baring">Maurice Baring</a> (though it should be noted that even after consulting tried and trusted sources, it is difficult to locate original sources of quotes).</p>
<p>My favourite poem when I was young and miserable was <strong>R&eacute;sum&eacute;</strong>:</p>
<p>Razors pain you<br />
Rivers are damp<br />
Acids stain you<br />
And drugs cause cramp.<br />
Guns aren't lawful<br />
Nooses give<br />
Gas smells awful<br />
You might as well live.</p>
