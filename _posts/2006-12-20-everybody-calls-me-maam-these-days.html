Fantastic news: an <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting={0C084F89-5673-43B9-9FFC-022578DAA927}">interview with Joss Whedon</a> about the season eight of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> in comic book form. Can it be as good as <a href="http://www.btvschosen.com/episodes.php">The Chosen</a>? Only if he performs the miracle <a href="http://www.jetwolf.com/buffy/">Jet Wolf</a> worked on Kennedy. And only if Anya's death is treated more respectfully than Tara's (like having some people other than Willow actually miss her).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002837101.cfm">An update</a> with some of the confirmed writers including the very funny <a href="http://www.janeespenson.com/">Jane Espenson</a> (a <a href="http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000182.php">classic entry</a>: "My parents got a new puppy this week. She's a teeny baby Bichon Frise whom they have named Zia. Can you believe these are the same people who came up with "Jane"? I suspect I'd've had a different life if I was named Zia Espenson. Not better, but different.").</p>
