<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image745" src="/images/uploads/2007/10/narcissus_nun.jpg" alt="Black Narcissus" /></div> <em>Black Narcissus</em> is a classic film with extraordinary performances and stunning colour cinematography by Jack Cardiff. <em>The Innocents</em> is one of the most atmospheric and scariest films I have ever seen with beautiful black and white cinematography from Freddie Francis. Both starred Deborah Kerr whose American films mostly left me cold (and that includes <em>From Here to Eternity</em>) but her British films were a different story.
