  content: yeah S5 finale was amazing.   Oh my re watching of Buffy I discovered I
    have a lot of time for Dawn - when she's annoying it's cos she's reacting to the
    way everyone else is treating her, i.e. badly.  She acts out and demands attention
    because the others ignore her otherwise and treat her like she's aged about 10
    and can't think for herself.

  content: "I love the Niblet. I don't understand the negativity a lot of people dump
    on her. I thought that retiring Joyce and bringing Dawn on board was an excellent
    trade. I thought the setup with Dawn was wonderful. I loved the way the terminally
    ill Joyce somehow knew that Dawn wasn't theirs, but that they must always take
    care of her as if she was a Summers girl. I thought Dawn's scenes with Spike were
    some of the best moments for both characters. \r\n\r\nI replay the scene atop
    Glory's tower over and over just to watch MT deliver her Dawnie lines with such
    wonderful facial and vocal expression. \r\n\r\nThe writers completely bungled
    the Dawn character in the final two seasons, separating her from Spike and ignoring
    her mystical origins, and, as you say, turning her into a klepto. The Little Bit
    deserved better. Maybe they should have let her jump off the tower in \"The Gift\"
    instead of Buffy, since they clearly had no idea what to do with her after that.
    \r\n\r\nOh, yeah, I also love that screen cap you used, beautifully framing the
    Summers girls at a moment which could have been their last together, had Willow
    not stepped in."

<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 19: Character You Like That Everyone Else Hates<br /></b><br />I&#39;m not keen on this question because I don&#39;t know who this mysterious everyone is. However, I&#39;ll make a stab and suggest that we are talking about characters like Riley, Dawn, and Kennedy.
<p /> I&#39;m sticking with that trio and out of them I&#39;ll say that I like Dawn. I thought Michelle Trachtenberg did a pretty good job despite having to struggle with situations written too young for her and with a role that trod water in S6 and 7. How great would it have been to take her origin and develop a storyline for her using that. Or how about Dawn becoming a watcher? Or how about Dawn being something more interesting than a klepto?<b>
<p /> </b>I liked her introduction to the show and thought the Key was a great idea which led to one of the best season finales.<b>
