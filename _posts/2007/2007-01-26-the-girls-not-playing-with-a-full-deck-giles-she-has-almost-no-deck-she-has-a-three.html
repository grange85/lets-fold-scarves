<p><strong>Faith, Hope and Trick</strong> (David Greenwalt)</p>
<p><img id="image285" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/faith-hope-and-trick.jpg" alt="Faith in Faith, Hope and Trick" /></p>
<p>Faith is a totally five-by-five welcome addition to the show. She&rsquo;s dynamic, complex, violent and insecure and manages to create tension with Buffy and Xander (who really doesn&rsquo;t know which side his bread is buttered on).</p>
<p>Cordy is looking very tanned in this series so far. Not &ldquo;just been on holiday tanned&rdquo; but &ldquo;not been on holiday but supposed to have been tanned&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Willow is always gazing at Oz, which seems to be the show's shorthand for infatuation and insecurity. Cordy doesn&rsquo;t gaze at Xander even after she falls in love with him because she is neither infatuated or insecure.</p>
<p>Scott is sweet and cute but not very interesting.</p>
<p>Old slouchy is back to meander rather listlessly through the rest of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let me get this straight. I'm really back in school because the school board overruled you. Wow. That's like having your whole ability to do this job called into question, when you think about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think what my daughter's trying to say is...nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, sage. I love that smell. And marnox root. You know, a smidge of this mixed with a virgin's saliva...does something I know nothing about.&rdquo; (Marnox root? very clever)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing...much. Well, you know, I tried this spell to cure Angel, and I guess that was a bust. But since then, you know, small stuff: floating feather, fire out of ice, which next time I won't do on the bedspread. Are you mad at me?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, of course not, no. If I were, I would be making a strange clucking sound with my tongue.&rdquo; (Willow is trying so much magic off camera, it would have been good to see more of that in action &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t her show so we get Bangel interludes instead)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check out Slut-O-Rama and her Disco Dave.&rdquo; (Cordelia succinctly introduces Faith)</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slaying just always makes you hungry and horny?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sometimes I-I crave a non-fat yoghurt afterwards.&rdquo; (Buffy&rsquo;s face is a picture)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oz is a werewolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's a long story.&rdquo; &ldquo;I got bit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Apparently not that long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, as long as you don't go scratching at me or humping my leg, we're five-by-five, you know?&rdquo; (snort)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil.&rdquo; (this was going to be my title but there is an even better line)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really do need to find the fun, B. Uffy&rdquo; (Willow is cute again)</p>
<p>&ldquo;She's very personable. She gets along with my friends, my Watcher, my mom. Look, now she's getting along with my fries.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, Buffy...&rdquo; &ldquo;Plus, at school today, she was making eyes at my not-boyfriend. This is creepy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but I'm the one getting single-white-femaled here.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's probably good you were an only child.&rdquo; (well, Buffy was right about <em>Ted</em> and Joyce&rsquo;s attitude changes when Faith has her tied up in <em>This Year&rsquo;s Girl</em>, and Buffy learns just how hard it is to have a sibling)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, the only way you get a new Slayer is when the old Slayer dies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then that means you, when did you die? You never told me you died!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it was just for a few minutes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I hate this. I hate your life. Look, I know you didn't choose this, I know it chose you. I have tried to march in the Slayer Pride parade, but...I don't want you to die.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm not gonna die. I know how to do my job. Besides, like you said, I've got help now.&rdquo; (this is a lovely scene between mother and daughter &ndash; I like the gay pride reference (see also the coming out scene in <em><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12956661">X-Men 2</a></em>) and Joyce articulating the fear of every parent that their child dies before them)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm five-by-five, B, living entirely large, actually wondering about your problem.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I may not sleep in the nude and wrassle alligators...&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe it's time you started, 'cause obviously something in your bottle needs uncorking. What is it, the Angel thing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you know about Angel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just what your friends tell me: big love, big loss. You oughta deal and move on, but you're not. &ldquo;I got an idea: how about from now on, we don't hear from you on Angel or anything else in my life. Which, by the way, is my life.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you getting so strung out for, B?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are your lips still moving, F?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did I just hear a threat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you like to?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wow. Think you can take me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; (oh, tension already, Kendra was too uptight for Buffy while Faith is way too loose, or at least it seems that way for the moment. It is amazing how much feeling can be expressed in the initials B and F)</p>
