We have just finished <em>Dead Like Me</em> season two and we are so disappointed that there is no more (except a <a href="http://www.syfyportal.com/news423577.html">rumoured DVD film</a>). It had so much still to offer. The cast were magnificent, it was funny, it was sad, it was clever, it was moving, it was off-colour, it was insightful, it was brilliant. And it made cry more times than any TV show I can think of.</p>

A special mention to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=christine+willes&search=Search">Christine Willes</a> as Delores who brightened up every scene even when a scene was already going somewhere and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britt_McKillip">Britt McKillip</a> as Reggie.</p>
