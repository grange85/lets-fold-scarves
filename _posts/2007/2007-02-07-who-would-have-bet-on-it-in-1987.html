  content: I think that works out at one decent song every four years...maybe not
    worth an exhibition - but those dungarees and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40943000/jpg/_40943407_spinning_presser.jpg"
    rel="nofollow">other classy outfits</a> will probably make it worthwhile ;)

<p>I think most of us thought that Kylie (or Charlene as most of us referred to her back then) would be lucky, lucky, lucky if her career had reached the 90s and yet the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6336337.stm">V&A</a> are honouring her <strong>twenty years</strong> in the business with an exhibition of her costumes. For <em>Better the Devil You Know</em>, <em>Step Back In Time</em>, <em>Confide in Me</em>, <em>Where the Wild Roses Grow</em> and <em>Can't Get You Out of My Head</em>, thanks Kylie.</p>
