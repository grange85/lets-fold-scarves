<p><strong>Fear Itself</strong> (<a href="http://www.davidfury.net/">David Fury</a>)<br />

<p>A fine episode which is an excellent example of the <em>BtVS</em> mix of comedy, drama and creepiness.</p>
<p>All the Scooby fears are dealt with and it doesn&rsquo;t feel heavy-handed. In fact, for the Willow fan here, there is joy to be had in dissecting any of Willow related remarks and in nodding knowingly that indeed she should be worried about &ldquo;power you can&rsquo;t control&rdquo;. And this was interesting: &ldquo;Then again, what is college for if not experimenting? You know, maybe I can handle it. I&rsquo;ll know when I&rsquo;ve reached my limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anya is very amusing in her lack of concern for anybody but Xander and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/interviews/caulfield/page2.shtml">Emma Caulfield</a>&rsquo;s line delivery is spot on. Half the humour in the following is solely down to the way she says it: &ldquo;Xander is in trouble. We&rsquo;ve got to do something, right now!&rdquo; &ldquo;Anya.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you listening? Xander is trapped!&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, ah, where is Buffy and the others?&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trapped, too, but we&rsquo;ve got to save Xander!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both <em>Living Conditions</em> and this have great endings: &ldquo;Actual size&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Funniest moments include Giles in a sombrero, Anya in a bunny costume and Giles wielding a chainsaw.</p>
<p>Cleverest exchange: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common, seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake, and plus she had that close relationship with God.&rdquo;  &ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; (Oz opens his jacket to reveal the name tag &ldquo;God&rdquo;) &ldquo;Of course. I wish I&rsquo;d thought of that before I put down my deposit. I could have been God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Blasphemer&rdquo;<br />
