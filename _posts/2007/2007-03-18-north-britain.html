<p>Jennie Bond's suggestion for alternative tourist spot is absent from the map in <a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6451225.stm">this article</a> on the BBC News Magazine. I find it quite frankly offensive that the top of mainland Britain has been omitted from the map <em>anyway</em> but it is adding insult to injury that the tenth destination is not even marked. It is no wonder the BBC is accused of a southern bias when it does this sort of thoughtless thing plus the daily insult of the tv weather map being skewed so that north Britain is smaller than south Britain. Sigh.</p>
