<p>I am lucky that sometimes I get to watch things at work that some people watch for pleasure. Working through a compilation of pop songs taken from various programmes of the 60s, 70s and 80s, it was with great delight that I came across this gem. I vaguely knew the song but it was this delightful, albeit lip-synced, rendition that made me go wow!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chachacharming.com/article.php?id=9">Reparata</a> & the Delrons were never really famous like the Shangri-Las and this wasn't even a hit in the USA but it was a top twenty success over here in 1968. 1968! It sounds more like a song from the late 70s.</p>
<p>It was sampled by Betty Boo for her pop classic from 1990, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM_9As_2VAg">Doin' the Do</a>". Watch out for the superb use of the "you're" from the line "You're going to lose a good thing".</p>
