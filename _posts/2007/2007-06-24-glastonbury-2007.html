  content: Ooh you make me sound like such a bloke that I now feel obliged to point
    out that I pretty much agree with everything. It is far to blokey, it is far too
    rawk. I'll add that Arcade Fire were pretty good too but otherwise it seems that
    modern mainstream-alternative music is probably at an all time low. My life will
    be richer if I never have to hear The Killers or The Editors or The Kooks or Amy
    Winehouse or Maximo Park or The Fratellis (shudder) or most of those other bands
    you mentioned ever again...

  content: Thank you, but while waiting for my cd to arrive I have YouTubed <i>Bat
    for Lashes</i> rather thoroughly so here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL-SikCeNDY"

<p>Here is a list of artists that I caught at least twenty seconds of who performed over the past couple of days: John Fogerty, Bj&ouml;rk, Amy Winehouse, Babyshambles, Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Bat for Lashes, The Killers, The Kooks, Klaxons, Iggy Pop, Dirty Pretty Things, The Fratellis, Max&iuml;mo Park, The Pigeon Detectives, <strike>Buffy</strike> Biffy Clyro, Lily Allen, Editors, Get Cape.Wear Cape.Fly.</p>
<p>With the notable exceptions of Bj&ouml;rk, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/batforlashes">Bat for Lashes</a> (who <strike>are</strike> is now my new favourite <strike>band</strike> artist) and that one song by Lily Allen (because the one after <em>Smile</em> sounded, as Andy said, like Chas and Dave) there were all <em>boring</em>.</p>
<p>Andy said you aren't being fair all you are doing is looking at the stage band to see if there any women there and dismissing the band if there aren't. I was silent for a moment and then said but that's maybe the point: they are all men. (I know, not Amy Winehouse.)</p>
<p>Obviously, not all music made by men is boring (duh) but the vast majority of music they show from Glastonbury is dull guitar rock with dreary vocals: 6 Music come alive (if that isn't a tautology).</p>
<p>I'm being unfair and showing my prejudices but it is so boring.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wpvm.org/sirensmuse/">Sirens' Muse</a> is a corrective that really made me feel that there is a heaven: Paula Frazer, Baird, Espvall & Kraus, Neko Case, Juliet Turner, Aimee Mann, Coach Said Not To, Shannon Wright, Joan as Police Woman, Tori Amos, Throwing Muses, Mirah, etc</p>
