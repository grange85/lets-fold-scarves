<p>The wife of the new Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7150476.stm">profiled</a> on the BBC News website. She's a lawyer but clearly what was as important was to mention the colour of her hair. And this truly bizarre paragraph,</p>
<blockquote><p>By keeping her own name, rather than taking her husband's, Ms Gonzalez Durantez seems to be following in the footsteps of Tony Blair's wife Cherie, who used the moniker Booth whenever she was working,</blockquote> makes me cringe. <em>Moniker</em> implies pseudonym and I don't think that Cherie Booth using the name she was given at birth (you know, her <em>real name</em>) can under any definition be pseudonymous. Also, it betrays ignorance of culture because according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_name">Wikipedia</a>: "In Spain, a woman does not ever change her official surnames when she marries." (awkward phrasing but you get the idea). And, of course, she would have definitely changed her name if the wife of the Labour leader had changed hers...</p>
