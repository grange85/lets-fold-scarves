<p><strong>Enemies</strong> (Doug Petrie)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image358" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/buffy-meh-face.jpg" alt="Buffy in Enemies" /><br/>How I felt watching this</div></p>
<p>A drama is in trouble when it uses the misinterpretation of an innocent incident when two characters are supposed to trust each other as a basis for the rest of the episode. Even when it jokes at this later on: &ldquo;But it's so clear the way he feels about you. Buffy, I too know the love of a taciturn man and you have to look at their actions.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was. &ldquo; &ldquo;Well, what did he say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Say? You mean when I straightforwardly asked him what was going on?&rdquo; &ldquo;So you bailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first time I saw this when I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on it was intriguing but second time it&rsquo;s a bit dull plus the demon owing Giles a favour was a corny and cheaty device. I&rsquo;m not intrigued by the Buffy and Angel angst and even Faith bored me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be hours. The girl makes Godot look punctual. I'll just go myself.&rdquo;  - make up your mind folks, is Buffy pay-attention gal or not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how some people hate to say I told you so? Not me. I told you so. Angel's back in the really bad sense, and uh, I told you so.&rdquo;  - I&rsquo;ll let Xander off this time</p>
