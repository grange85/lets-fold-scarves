    If they would've put Amber Benson in title sequence back in season 4 like they should have, it would have seriously remedied this problem.

    One of my friends told me he read something where Joss said the events of season 6 were all supposed to happen in season 5, which is why they never wanted to make Tara a "main character" - because they were planning on killing her pretty quickly.  But the Tara/Willow dynamic was just so good they decided to give it more time.  And by then, the "no Tara in the credits" thing was just ingrained, and he wanted to do the other trick of only bringing her in for her last episode.

    Not fair to jerk around the best of the bunch like that, I think.

    the opening scene between young River and her teacher? Does that count?"

<p><a href="http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/27179.html">StephenT</a> has a very interesting analysis of the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> opening credits in terms of its female to male regular cast ratio.</p>
<p>And does <em>Serenity</em> pass the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=34585797&amp;size=l">Bechdel Test</a>? I was hopeful for the deleted scene when Inara and another companion discuss Inara's teaching abilities but then they move on to talking about men because that's what they <em>do</em>.</p>
