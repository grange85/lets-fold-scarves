<p><strong>The Prom</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>

Sentimental or moving? Well, only one episode of <em>BtVS</em> made me cry and it wasn&rsquo;t this or <em>Seeing Red</em>.</p>
<p>Anya: &ldquo;You know, you can laugh, but I have witnessed a millennium of treachery and oppression from the males of the species and I have nothing but contempt for the whole libidinous lot of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why you talking to me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't have a date for the prom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What exactly is Wesley doing wandering around Sunnydale High? And, why would he be chaperoning a high school dance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Buffy&rsquo;s world, we just live in it&rdquo; I do appreciate that sentiment but I care much more about Willow and her relationships and Xander and his than I do about Buffy&rsquo;s. Maybe it&rsquo;s the drawn out masochistic nature of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Right there, zoom in on that.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's a videotape.&rdquo; &ldquo;So? They do it on television all the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not with a regular VCR they don't.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a bit much making fun of this aspect of tv when <em>BtVS</em>&rsquo;s computer skills leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Xander buying Cordelia&rsquo;s dress is a really nice touch. I will be happy to know differently but does he ever mention her again?</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s lonely fight with the hellhounds with almost no witnesses seems to be a sad moment but the students of SHS are not quite as blind as we thought.</p>
