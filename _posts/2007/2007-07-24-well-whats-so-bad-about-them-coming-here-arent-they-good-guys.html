    While I agree with your assessment of The Watcher's Council I have to say that I rather like the female watcher in this episode. I'm not sure why.

    This episode continues to portray Buffy's college professors as absolute narcissists and just plain meanyheads. Perhaps big university professors are that harsh on their students, but my small liberal arts college professors were always happy for student participation. I like that the writers hint that Buffy has been taking a different perspective on history due to her knowledge of the supernatural.

    I don't mind Buffy's big speech at the end of the episode (the last one that won't make me want to smack her), but I think I enjoy the speech because of the Scoobies' reactions in the peanut gallery. It's like The Council has forced them to sit at the kiddie table, but Buffy negotiates for their place at the dining table with the grown-ups.
    <blockquote><b>Buffy</b>: We're talking about two powerful witches and a thousand-year-old ex-demon.
    <b>Anya</b>: Willow's a demon!?</blockquote>
    Bad lying is only funny (rather than annoying) when no one is buying it. None of the Council members seem that surprised by the reveal that Anya is an ex-demon. Do you think they knew she used to be Anyanka?

    I'm trying to figure out the significance of the sword at the end there. It seems to represent the power of the male-dominated Watcher's Council and, of course, Knights of Byzantium. Buffy places it in front of Quentin as if to say, "Your power is tiny and nonthreatening." But Buffy also uses the sword against the Council, which suggests that maybe it's her power too.... Maybe I'm looking for symbolism where there is none.

    I hate the rudding Knights of Byzantium. Men espousing values of the Middle Ages and literally dressed like they're from that era? Yawn.

<p><strong>Checkpoint</strong> (Jane Espenson and Douglas Petrie)

<p>Episodes like this leave me a bit stuck for words: the Watchers' Council has that effect. The bizarre "Englishness" of the characters doesn't help (maybe Joss as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_College">Old Wykehamist</a> hasn't actually met any ordinary Brits) and if you are going to hint strongly about a paternalistic organization why not go the whole hog and stop foisting female Watchers on us. And if a Watcher is paid then why isn't the Slayer?</p>
<p>The highlight of the episode is the amusing montage of interviews in which Willow actually manages to be cute. It's a well worn but fun device next seen in <em><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dT7HBX-E85A">Entropy</a></em>. My favourite bit is when Tara makes an inspired guess at level five.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image645" src="/images/uploads/2007/07/checkpoint-the-gang.jpg" alt="Checkpoint - the gang" /></div>Buffy's speech may be the last of the effective ones. I love the gang watching from the gallery with their legs dangling over the edge (except - oh, go on, have a drink).</p>
<p>Poor Amber getting saddled with lines like this: "Are you sure they're English? I-I thought English people were, um, gentler, then, uh, normal..."</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image644" src="/images/uploads/2007/07/checkpoint-glory-and-jinx.jpg" alt="Checkpoint - Glory and Jinx" /></div>I owe Clare Kramer an apology. She is getting into her stride as Glory and her relationship with her minions is fun.</p>
<p>And a big hello to the Knights of Byzantium.</p>
