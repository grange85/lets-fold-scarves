<p><strong>Intervention</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image704" src="/images/uploads/2007/09/intervention-two-buffys.jpg" alt="Intervention - Buffys" /></div>In order for this episode to work you just have to accept that Willow and Xander are the worst friends <em>ever</em>. They can't tell that Buffy is a robot? That's sad but having said that, it still manages to be very funny with a great ending.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image702" src="/images/uploads/2007/09/intervention-buffy-and-giles.jpg" alt="Intervention - Buffy and Giles" /></div>Buffy goes on a quest to find her humanity which leads to the same patch of desert as seen in <em>Restless</em>, Giles shaking a gourd and Buffy's rather sad sounding, "and that's what it's all about".</p>
<p>I love the line "Weird love's better than no love" and then the cut to Spike and Warren. Weird love may sum up the rest of <em>BtVS</em>. (And yes, Warren is packing.)</p>
<p>SMG is so good as Buffybot that I remember thinking she must have been having a quiet time this episode because she wasn't in many scenes...</p>
<p>That is one domesticated looking cougar: it has a belly like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/1338321004/">Wash</a>. Not that one.</p>
<p>I love how Emma Caulfield delivers these lines in this episode: "So really it was only bad for the falsely accused, and, well, they never have a good time" and "Buffy's boinking Spike". The Anya love comes to a screeching halt in <em>Tough Love</em>.</p>
<p>Is this our first sign of klepto Dawn?</p>
<p>"<a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-bigbad.wav">Oh, Spike, you're the Big Bad</a>" makes me chuckle.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image705" src="/images/uploads/2007/09/intervention-willow-and-tara.jpg" alt="Intervention - Willow and Tara" /></div>Tara and Willow are intimate on the sofa but then, oh dear koalas, and the great leap sideways. "Oh, well, Tara's right. Grief can be powerful, and we shouldn't judge..." "What are you, kidding? She's nuts!"</p>
<p>We really, really, really could have done without the blow-job.</p>
<p>"Buffy, there is something seriously wrong here." Yes, your total inability to work out your friend is not your friend, Willow.</p>
<p>One of my favourite lines: "Angel's lame. His hair grows straight up, and he's bloody stupid."</p>
<p>Spike being tortured is horrible.</p>
<p>Anya asks "shouldn't we have guns?".</p>
<p>When they send Buffy upstairs to change (which she doesn't), I thought this was the point that the Scoobies were going to crack their extremely puzzling conundrum but, no, they continue to be extremely stupid instead. However, we would been deprived of "<a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-huh.wav">The who whatting how with huh?</a>" and "Spike is strong and mysterious and sort of compact but well muscled." "I am not having sex with Spike! But I'm starting to think that you might be."</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image703" src="/images/uploads/2007/09/intervention-spike-and-buffy.jpg" alt="Intervention - Buffy and Spike" /></div>The final scene is one of the best (even though Spike looks gross) with some fine acting. "What you did, for me, and Dawn, that was real. I won't forget it."</p>
