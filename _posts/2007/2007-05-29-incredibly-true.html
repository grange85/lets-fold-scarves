<p>Except for the fact it was <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> that made me spend all that money: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/dearjoss/4614.html">this list</a> is the same as mine (except add <em>Wonderfalls</em> and <em>Dead Like Me</em> for <em>Farscape</em>). So <em>Farscape</em>, hmm...</p>
<p>And the early issues of <em>Runaways</em> have made me love Brian K. Vaughan which in turn has led to more spending.</p>
