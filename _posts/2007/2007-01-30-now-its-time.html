<p><img id="image312" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/paula-now-173.jpg" class="left" alt="Paula Frazer and Tarnation - Now It's Time" /> Surely now it's time for the world to wake up to <strong>Paula Frazer</strong>. Her new album <em>Now It's Time</em> is out at the end of February and if the two tracks on her <a href="  http://www.myspace.com/paulafrazer  ">MySpace</a> space are anything to go by it is is going to sound as majestic as ever. Her voice is quite simply gorgeous and <em>Pretend</em> is an instant classic.</p>
<p>The record is released on Birdman Records but it is not yet available for pre-order.<br clear="all"/></p>
