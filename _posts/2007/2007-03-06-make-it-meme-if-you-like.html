    And here are my equally important answers :)

    Favorite Buffy story: I love the story arc of Spike growing as a (non)person, especially the fact that he doesn't grow consistently, the evil and mistakes still creep in - it's not simplified.

    Least favorite Buffy story: The initiative arc. While I am a fan of government conspiracy theories, this one didn't ring true for me.

    Favorite big bad: The First. I'm not saying it was represented as well as it could have been, but I love the concept.

    Least favorite big bad: Adam. Lame.

    Favorite season: Season 6. Followed closely by 3.

    Least favorite season: Season 5. The whole Glory story did nothing for me. The horses, the Winebago, Ben, Dawn, minions, the whole deal. Not my favorite.

    Best laugh out loud Buffy moment: In Hush,when they are having their overhead transparency show in the lecture hall and Buffy pretty much says WTF? when Giles has drawn her hips so large. Cracks me up every time.

    Most underdeveloped character: Oz. I wish he'd have stayed party of the gang longer.

    Best Buffy moment: Ironically, in my least favorite season (5) the picture of Spike devastated after Buffy jumps.

    (Adding a category here) Character whose fabulosity is too often overlooked: Drusilla.

    FAVOURITE BUFFY STORY: Call me sentimental, but Prophecy Girl strikes a real chord in me. I also love the storyline when Angel becomes Angelus and your favorite.


    LEAST FAVOURITE BUFFY STORY: Willow&rsquo;s magic addiction and the subsequent neutering of her character. - DITTO!

    FAVOURITE BIG BAD: Angelus. It was just a great storyline. The Mayor would be a very close second.

    LEAST FAVOURITE BIG BAD: Glory. If you think Adam is boring...

    FAVOURITE SEASON: Overall, I'd have to say Season 3, closely followed by Season 2 and Season 4.

    LEAST FAVOURITE SEASON: Season seven. No contest.

    BEST LAUGH-OUT-LOUD BUFFY MOMENT: In Halloween, when GhostWillow goes to find Giles - we see Giles is filing cards in the card catalog, and then the shot shifts to show Giles hands and GhostWillow walking through the wall, and the cards go flying. I remember the first time I saw this, I laughed so hard that Siobhan came in from the other room to see what I was laughing at.

    MOST UNDERDEVELOPED CHARACTER: Tara

    (and instead of CHARACTER YOU&rsquo;D LIKE TO DATE) BEST BUFFY MOMENT: When Buffy goes to kill the master even though she knows the prophecy says she's going to die. I think that's a defining moment for the series.

    ap and Maureen, thanks for your comments; I'm always thrilled to get comments from someone who isn't my husband :-)

    "The whole Glory story did nothing for me. The horses, the Winebago, Ben, Dawn, minions, the whole deal. Not my favorite." OMG, the Winnebago and the horses: I totally removed them from my mind...but in Glory's defence she was much prettier than Adam.

    oh-oh - here comes your husband!

    Glory made me laugh but Ben was just creepy. Poor Adam - it seems nobody liked him...I sort of liked the whole-gang-gets-together-to-defeat-him thing - not that it was particularly well realised - but a nice concept (hmmm "what can't we do if we're together").

    Funniest moment = "shhh...grrruff...bad dog" although just thinking about the overhead=projector bit in Hush is making me laugh now!

    Best big bad = The Mayor, because he made me laugh and because of all the stuff that happened around him - even if the ascension was a bit rubbish.

    As for Jeph Loeb and Buffy's "feminist manifesto" - as a male I can assure him it's not a "male thing" but more likely a "writing (or talking) without thinking thing"...or possibly a "complete misunderstanding thing"...

<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003709924.cfm">this interview</a> with Joss Whedon, Brian K. Vaughan and Jeph Loeb at Wizard, here are my equally important answers:</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE BUFFY STORY</strong>: <em>This Year's Girl </em>and <em>Who Are You</em>. Faith wakes up from her coma and tries to get revenge but ends up gaining insight into herself. Sarah Michelle Gellar is awesome and there are at least three fantastic scenes: "I could squeeze you until you popped like warm champagne", Tara and Willow do a spell and Faith and Buffy have a very important fight.</p>
<p><strong>LEAST FAVOURITE BUFFY STORY</strong>: Willow's magic addiction and the subsequent neutering of her character.</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE BIG BAD</strong>: Angelus. He killed Jenny Calendar!</p>
<p><strong>LEAST FAVOURITE BIG BAD</strong>: Adam. He was so boring.</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE SEASON</strong>: Despite my low opinion of the Initiative (as embodied by Forrest and Graham) and of the tedium of Adam, season four is my favourite season because it has <strong><em>so</em></strong> many good episodes, Spike was funny, it re-introduced Anya and introduced Tara. Roll call: <em>Fear, Itself</em>, <em>Wild at Heart</em>, <em>Pangs</em>, <em>Something Blue</em>, <em>Hush</em>, <em>A New Man</em>, <em>Who Are You</em>, <em>New Moon Rising</em>, and <em>Restless</em>.</p>
<p><strong>LEAST FAVOURITE SEASON</strong>: Season seven. No contest.</p>
<p><strong>BEST LAUGH-OUT-LOUD BUFFY MOMENT</strong>: Hmm, how to choose from so many? Spike taunting Angel behind Joyce's back in <em>Lovers Walk</em>? Willow wanting Xander to be her first in <em>Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered</em>? The Scoobies mourning Willow in <em>Doppelgangland</em> and their reaction when she turns up? Xander thinking about sex in <em>Earshot</em>? Giles chasing after Professor Walsh in <em>A New Man</em>? Buffy and Spike engaged in <em>Something Blue</em>? The overhead projector scene in <em>Hush</em>? Spike realising he's English in <em>Tabula Rasa</em>? Willow's hats? I really can't decide.</p>
<p><strong>MOST UNDERDEVELOPED CHARACTER</strong>: Dawn, followed by Anya, followed by Tara.</p>
<p>(and instead of CHARACTER YOU&rsquo;D LIKE TO DATE) <strong>BEST BUFFY MOMENT</strong>: Tara and Willow clasping hands in <em>Hush</em> and together moving the vending machine.<br /><br />
<img id="image383" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/hush.jpg" class "left" alt="Tara and Willow in Hush moving a vending machine" /><br clear="all" /></p>
<p>===</p>
<p>I am dismayed by Jeph Loeb's comments: "There were times I enjoyed &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; more than I enjoyed &ldquo;Buffy.&rdquo; That may just be a male thing; sometimes Joss&rsquo; feminist manifesto would get to me, whereas &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; was just a big rollicking detective show with great characters." I don't care that he prefers Angel but I do care that "Joss' feminist manifesto" bothered him. First, having a female leading character doesn't equal feminist and second, just how exactly does this "manifesto" manifest itself?</p>
