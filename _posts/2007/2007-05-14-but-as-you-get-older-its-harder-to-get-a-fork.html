<p>I feel mean just mentioning Christine Willes and Britt McKillip so here&rsquo;s all the others who made <em>Dead Like Me</em> so amazing.</p>
<p>First, the Americans:</p>
<p>Ellen Muth as George: &ldquo;but if death sneaks up on you, the only thing you have time to think is&hellip; Aw, shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mandy Patinkin as Rube: &ldquo;What you're feeling right now, the rage and frustration all knotted together, binding everything from your head to your digestive tracks? That's my life with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasmine Guy as Roxy: &ldquo;Sir, I'm going to say this as politely as possible. I will fuck you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia Idlette as Kiffany: "Excuse me. What&rsquo;s the first thought that enters your head when you finish a job?" "What?" "What is the first thought that enters your head when you finish a job?" "I hope they&rsquo;re happy."</p>
<p>Second, the Canadians:</p>
<p>Cynthia Stevenson as Joy: &ldquo;Where are my effing keys?&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe they're in your effing purse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Reggie! Don't say effing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura Harris as Daisy, Daisy Adair: &ldquo;Why has no one ever loved me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah Lind as Stephanie: &ldquo;It's going to take over yellow. It doesn't stand a chance. Poor yellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crystal Dahl as Crystal: she doesn&rsquo;t say much</p>
<p>Now the Brit:</p>
<p>Callum Blue as Mason: &ldquo;Fucking bloody hell.&rdquo;</p>
