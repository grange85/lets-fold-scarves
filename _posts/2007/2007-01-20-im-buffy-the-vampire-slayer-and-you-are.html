<p><strong>Anne</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>

There are two entirely different storylines in this and it didn't really work to have them interspersed with each other. I like the gloominess of the Anne story but I also think how much you enjoy this episode depends on much you care about Lily and I cared a lot. Julia Lee gave a lovely, sad, sweet performance. The Scoobies coping back home is no match for Anne&rsquo;s story and the Xander/Cordelia subplot just tees me off. Cordelia is so looking forward to seeing Xander, but their awkward reunion makes me cross because it makes no sense; they were happy at the end of last season and it feels contrived and not particularly interesting.  Her feelings for him are just being set up for a fall and it seems that happiness just isn&rsquo;t on the Joss agenda for any couple. It is unpleasant that Xander when he's peeved can consider the notion that Cordelia is only fit for &ldquo;bait&rdquo;. A dream gives me the first of many unwelcome Bangel moments of season three and, with a couple of notable exceptions, Buffy&rsquo;s dreams are usually cack.There is an hilarious moment in the blood bank when someone says &ldquo;ow&rdquo; off screen and Buffy looks discomforted. Finally, I love the super fight sequence with the huge set, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunga_Munga">hunga munga</a> and Lily discovering her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's right, Big Boy. Come and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought, but in a way, I feel like we took her punning for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img id="image273" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/lily-and-anne.jpg" class="left" alt="Lily and Anne" />&ldquo;Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway. <a href="http://www.wild-harvest.com/pages/chanterelle.htm">Chanterelle</a> was part of my exotic phase.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's nice. It's a mushroom.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is? That's really embarrassing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Um, well, it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, before that, I was following this loser <a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/caleb/">preacher</a> and calling myself Sister Sunshine.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do they call you at home?&rdquo; (with her lack of reply, I say, poor Lily)<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here.&rdquo; (Ken gives the game away)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't. I blame you. You&rsquo;ve been this huge influence on her, guiding her. You had this whole relationship with her behind my back. I feel like you've taken her away from me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn't make Buffy who she is.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who exactly is she?&rdquo; (Joyce isn&rsquo;t exactly as livid as I&rsquo;d like but at least there is this little conversation for her to make a point)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This'll probably go faster if we split up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I come with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, where did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?&rdquo; (poor Lily)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?&rdquo; &ldquo;Gandhi?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I be &ldquo;Anne&rdquo;'?&rdquo; (if it gives you strength)</p>
