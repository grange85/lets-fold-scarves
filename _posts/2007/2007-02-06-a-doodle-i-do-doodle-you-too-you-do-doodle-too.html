<p><strong>Gingerbread</strong> (story by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820692/">Thania St. John</a> and Jane Espenson, written by Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>This had the feel of a season one episode and really isn&rsquo;t very good apart from the scene between Willow and her mother.</p>
<p>Clearly, teamwork is a metaphor for forgiveness because after this episode there isn&rsquo;t any more tension between Oz and Xander.</p>
<p>Sorry to bang on about Cordelia but now I remember why didn't like her much first time round; all I can remember is the horrible scenes she has in the second half of season three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It's just... This hall is about school, and you're about home. Mix them, my world dissolves.&rdquo; (Buffy obviously did well in chemistry)</p>
<p> &ldquo;Oh, I should say it's just beginning. Fight it if you want. Just remember, lift a finger against me, and you'll have to answer to MOO.&rdquo; &ldquo;Answer to MOO? Did that sentence just make some sense that I'm not in on?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mothers Opposed to the Occult. A powerful new group.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who came up with that lame name?&rdquo; &ldquo;That would be the founder. I believe you call her Mom' (Snyder is such a meanie and relishes these moments of superiority which he dishes out with such condescension)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, how would you know what I can do? I mean, the last time we had a conversation over three minutes, it was about the patriarchal bias of the Mr. Rogers Show.&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t get the reference but it&rsquo;s funny)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, I'm not acting out. I'm a witch! I can make pencils float. And I can summon the four elements. Okay, two, but four soon. And I'm dating a musician.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Willow!&rdquo; &ldquo;I worship Beelzebub. I do his biddings. Do you see any goats around? No, because I sacrificed them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Willow, please!&rdquo; &ldquo;All bow before Satan!&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm not listening to this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prince of Night, I summon you. Come fill me with your black, naughty evil.&rdquo; (&ldquo;black, naughty evil&rdquo; &ndash; both funny and shivery)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really win. The bad keeps coming back and getting stronger. Like that kid in the story, the boy that stuck his finger in the duck.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dyke.&rdquo; (look from Buffy) &ldquo;It's another word for dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go trade my cow in for some beans.&rdquo;</p>
