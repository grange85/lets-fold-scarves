<p>Type <strong>pop culture heroines</strong> into Google and it asks you if you meant <strong>pop culture heroes</strong>. Which is obviously why a blog called <a href="http://www.popcultureheroines.com/">Pop Culture Heroines</a> is needed.</p>
<p>It uses the lovely <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=10-849">Joshua Middleton</a> cover of River from the Serenity comic books in its banner.
