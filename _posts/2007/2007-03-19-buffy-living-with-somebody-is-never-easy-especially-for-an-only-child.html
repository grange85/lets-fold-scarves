<p><strong>Living Conditions</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>

Room-mates are a nightmare worse than sharing with your sisters because at least they are related. When I was at college in Aberdeen, I once shared with a lassie who worked in the bakery department of Tesco (or was it Asda?) and got up at five to go to work. Her alarm instantly woke me up while she would just sleep through it until I had to shout at her to wake up. Luckily, she didn&rsquo;t take the snapping personally. Otherwise, I have just flat-shared with relatively normal people who never labelled their food.</p>
<p>Dagney Kerr is wonderful as Kathy, just the right side of truly irritating. However, Buffy&rsquo;s friends really ought to trust her because despite behaving badly, she was also being de-souled by Kathy and so was right to be paranoid. They should remember Ted!</p>
<p>It could be considered a bit of an insult to the millions of people who bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ladies-Wigs-Black-Cher-Wig/dp/B000LWANHC/ref=sr_1_5/202-7278277-2103812?ie=UTF8&s=kids&qid=1174248828&sr=1-5">Cher </a>'s <em>Believe</em> that they are soulless. It was number one in the UK for seven weeks and is the best selling single by a female artist which is astonishing...</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun watching Buffy being bitchy and competitive ("OK, so that was the evil twin, right? Cause she was bordering on Cordelia-esque") which is a major reason why I like <em>Homecoming</em>.</p>
<p>Urgh, Parker, that's all I have to say for just now.</p>
<p>I'm sure that Xander didn't want to hear this: "Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys usually populate the non-campus?" because it's rude and demoralising.</p>
<p><img id="image409" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/veruca.jpg" class="left" alt="Veruca in Living conditions" />However, the most important part of this episode is a touch of foreshadowing as Oz and Veruca sniff each other out.<br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Willow wears the first of this season's fashion disasters with her holey poncho.</p>
<p>"Hmm hmm, sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning." "Hmm hmm, and guess what? You were next to it."</p>
<p>"So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine for her." "Well, I didn't do either, actually.  But she deserves it, don't you think?" "Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy."</p>
<p>"Buffy, this has to stop.  I mean I get it, I have a sucky roomie, too.  But you just have to deal." "You're right, I've been thinking a lot about this and it's clear to me now." "Good, that's better." " Kathy's evil.  I'm an evil fighter.  It's simple...I'm gonna have to kill her."</p>
