<p>We just watched the first episode of <em>Angel</em> and the pilot of <em>Dead Like Me</em>. One left me with a feeling that it must improve as a series because it was full of holes and questions that need answering. While the other left me feeling even if it doesn&rsquo;t get better then it's still a cracking seventy minutes of funny and inventive drama which makes me think that Joss Whedon isn&rsquo;t the only one in tv who can pull off the mix of the fantastic, comedic and dramatic.
