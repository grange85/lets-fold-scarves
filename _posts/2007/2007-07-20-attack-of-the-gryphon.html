    To be honest - I love that part of Buffy, the "ugh! what were they thinking" is just another thing that puts it above most other shows because the costumes were obviously chosen to solicit just that response (surely no one would have chosen some of those outfits for any other reason).

    And it shows a glorious arrogance - we can dress Tara in "schlumpy" costumes and put the silly hats on Willow because it adds something (that maybe only the fans really "get") and takes nothing away from the show.

  content: I didn't think that Buffy looked that bad in season three or season six,
    but she was getting really simple outfits in that later season. On the whole,
    I think that the costuming was best in season three. Season seven was okay, though
    Xander wore a lot of flannel.

  content: The costuming was never good (season 1 - why isn't Buffy wearing pants
    with that shirt? season 2 - the giraffe pants in Innocence? season 3 - Buffy joins
    the Junior League), but damn, from season 4 on the costuming was just completely
    horrific, and I feel like they went out of their way to make Tara look schlumpy.

  content: It is from <i>Crush</i> and, of course, it is just horrible (and Willow
    later wears a jumper with little dogs sewn on it which is also distractingly horrible).

    Isn't that from "Crush"? Horrid, horrid shirt.

    I almost made a comment about her wearing another ugly pink shirt with leopard print, but then realized that is the leopard print shirt. Ew. Just, ew.
