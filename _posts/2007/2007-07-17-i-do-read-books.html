  content: I've read <i>A Handmaid's Tale</i> and <i>Alias Grace</i>. <i>Alias
    Grace</i> was absorbing but didn't answer the central question (not that I
    think it ever intended to do so but I like a conclusion). <i>A Handmaid's Tale</i>
    seems more pertinent in a world of increasing religious extremism than it did
    when first published.

  content: Have you read any other novels by Margaret Atwood? <i>A Handmaid's Tale</i>
    is one of my favorite novels, and I also really enjoyed <i>The Edible Woman</i>
    and <i>Bodily Harm</i>. I haven't read <i>Oryx and Crake</i> as yet.

<p>Literary criticism is hard for me so here is a list of the recently read:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Tenderness of Wolves</em> by Stef Penney. Stef came in for a hard time because she has never been to Canada and yet wrote a book about the place. I guess she has never been to 1867 either. Stupid, stupid criticism of a moody book which has maybe too many fascinating characters with their all too brief stories. Recommended and I am looking forward to her second book already.</li>
<li><em>Oryx and Crake</em> by Margaret Atwood. Ah, speculative fiction or sf as it is usually known. Despite Atwood's lack of commitment to the genre, this is science fiction and very well written too, unlike:</li>
<li><em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy which I could not get into due to the liberal chucking around of obscure words. I don't know how it ends, I returned it to the library.</li>
<li><em>Carol</em> (aka <em>The Price of Salt</em>) by Patrica Highsmith. Apparently first published as pulp fiction. What a treat to read pulp this good. Trademark unsympathetic characters but entirely gripping.</li>
<li><em>As Meat Loves Salt</em> by Maria McCann. Slash fiction. Jacob is a pig of a man but I loved reading his story and his love for Ferris. Impeccable Civil War detail. Someone else whose next novel I am looking forward to.</li>
<li><em>1984</em> by George Orwell. First read at school, I read this every few years and never tire of it. It always seems particularly revelant. He was a genius.</li>
<li><em>Observations</em> by Jane Harris. Written in Scots and Northern Irish dialect, this was really easy to get into. However, despite the thrilling feeling that it was going to all <em>Fingersmith</em> on us, it didn't and just ended poorly. Nice try though.</li></ul><br />
