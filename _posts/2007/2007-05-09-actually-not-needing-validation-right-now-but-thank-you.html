<p><strong>Superstar</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>I enjoyed this episode a lot except for the last leaden minutes but I haven't much to say about it.</p>
<p>Jonathan says watch out for southpaws but this may have been the proof the Scoobies needed: he isn&rsquo;t one. And he may not know how to deal with his own inadequacies but he does give Buffy and Riley sound advice.</p>

<p>The scenes with Anya being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anya_Jenkins#Is_Anya_a_metaphor_for_autism.3F">metaphor-for-autism</a> are classic: "Oh you're still here. That's nice." and later: "Stop with the shrimp I am trying to do something here!"</p>

<p>"Did anyone else feel way too tall? I felt way too tall."</p>
