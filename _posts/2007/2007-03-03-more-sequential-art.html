<p>In the outer world of the Internet there are two major discussions concerning the depiction of women in comics and getting women to read comics. These two topics are often not mutually exclusive because I guess there aren't a huge amount of women who read <em>Nuts</em> and other offensive non-top shelf magazines for the same reasons they don't read comics with covers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AmazonGlory.JPG">this</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't read and have no intention of reading comics which are likely to offend me as a woman (life is far far too short). However, I do like comics so I have been lurking and absorbing suggestions for comics that women might like (I shan't get into discussing the notion that women en mass like <em>anything</em> because if that was true I would think Jamie Cullum was awfully cute). But on that note, here are some comics I have read recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strangers in Paradise</strong> (Terry Moore) I am up to #86 and this soapy ride of high drama, weepy moments and hilarity is remarkably good. It has been inconsistent but never dull.</li>
<li><strong>Ex Machina Vol 1: The First Hundred Days</strong> (Brian K. Vaughan) I raced through this and I am thoroughly impressed at the marriage of politics and super-hero but there is one sentence that made me ewww and I hope its like won't be repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Global Frequency: Planet Ablaze</strong> (Warren Ellis) The art greatly influenced whether I liked the issue or not with the Norwegian and London ones being stand outs due to the work by Jon J. Muth (<strong>Big Sky</strong>) and David Lloyd (<strong>The Run</strong>). I hated the bionic man one (<strong>Big Wheel</strong>) because Fabry's art is ugly.</li>
<li> <strong>Serenity: Those Left Behind</strong> (Joss Whedon and Brett Matthews) What a crock. I don't think I can emphasise just how disappointing this was in its utter feebleness. The art was inconsistent, the story weak and the dialogue so-so. It did nothing I hoped it would which in particular would have been to find out more about the enigmatic Shepherd Book.</li>
<li><strong>Astonishing X-Men #1-12</strong> (Joss Whedon) <strong>Gifted</strong> was fine and I eagerly anticipated <strong>Dangerous</strong> which was BtVS season 7 awful and I wanted to cry because it was so lame.</li>
<li><strong>Neverwhere #1&ndash;4</strong> (Mike Carey) This is based on Neil Gaiman's work set in an underground London. The settings didn't convince and I really dislike Glenn Fabry's art so I won't be seeking out the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Summer of Love</strong> (Debbie Drechsler) A simply drawn graphic novel of small town life which was absorbing but like most coming of age dramas it didn't have a satisfactory ending which is like life I suppose but slightly deflating to read.</li>
<li><strong>V for Vendetta</strong> (Alan Moore) Fantastic stuff: lots to think about, strong characters and a superb ending. Plus dolls and the letter V all over the place.</li>
<li><strong>Runaways vol. 1 #1-18, Runaways vol. 2 #1-12 and Runaways vol. 2 #13-18</strong> (Brian K. Vaughan) The first 12 issues are totally awesome with the cleverest conclusion I seen or read in a long time. Volume 2 was always going to pale in comparison and I thought the release of Karolina from her earthly bonds was weak (and the art wasn't by Alphona!).<br />
</ul></p>
