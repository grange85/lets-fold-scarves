<p>According her <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=27395615&blogID=252904516&MyToken=f4d7f78d-c986-4170-8975-87e79c7f4e10">myspace blog</a>, Paula Frazer's European tour has been cancelled. I'm not joining myspace so I can express my disappointment so I will say it here instead. I would have gladly donated money to help out so remember that next time...</p>
<p>For the next best thing to seeing her live, take a look at the video for <a href="http://www.birdmanrecords.com/paulafrazer/media.html">Always On My Mind</a> on the Birdman site.</p>
