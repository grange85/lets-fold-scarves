    So you just watch it for the violence?

    (So that's why you couldn't find a decent framegrab - it needs motion to truly work!)

<p><strong>Beauty and the Beasts</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marti_Noxon#Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Marti Noxon</a>)</p>
<p>I would rather watch a poor monster of the week episode than one as preachy as this. In a mainly dour episode that is the definition of <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/articles/content/a5782/">anvilicious</a> the best moments include Willow whispering &ldquo;rabbits&rdquo; only to have werewolf Oz get cross, Giles being very angry with Xander, Willow being cool in the morgue (Cordelia&rsquo;s &ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m just saying&rdquo; is so like my son), Oz's &ldquo;I may be a cold-blooded jelly doughnut, but my timing is impeccable&rdquo;, Giles getting tranquillised, and a couple of dialogue exchanges:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? Bet you and Scott have been up there kicking the gearshift.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hardly. Only been on a few dates.&rdquo; &ldquo;But you like him. And when you think about him, you get that good, down-low tickle, right?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, I guess, but...how low?&rdquo; &ldquo;You tell me.&rdquo; (oo, that Faith is so saucy)</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries. I can handle the Oz full Monty. I mean, not handle handle, like hands to flesh handle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay. Well, it's not for you. It's for me, cause I'm still getting used to half a Monty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. Good. Half? You and Oz? Which half?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wouldn't you like to know?&rdquo; (poor Xander, he can&rsquo;t handle that Willow and Oz may be getting more than he is with Cordelia)</p>
<p>Hard to take moments include Oz rejecting Willow&rsquo;s concern, Angel wearing trousers, Buffy talking to Giles about a &ldquo;vivid. Really vivid. Three-dimensional, sensurround, the hills are alive &ldquo;dream&rdquo; (wearing a most unflattering vest), Pete and Debbie, the scene in the toilets where I think Buffy is too harsh on Debbie (maybe she&rsquo;s right but who is she to say &ldquo;Great. So what, you two live out your Grimm fairy tale? Two people are dead&rdquo;?).</p>
<p>The best moment by far is Faith clocking Buffy: a moment for rewinding and replaying several times.<br />
