<p>This isn't a patch on the first two films. It didn't help that I sat through it seething that Princess Fiona is the heir of the King and should be Queen on his death: Shrek is just her husband and has no right to the throne of Far Far Away (ask Prince Philip). It wouldn't have taken a minute of screen time to explain and still have Shrek and co going on the voyage to find Artie because Fiona didn't want to be Queen. What would <a href="http://www.seejane.org/">Geena Davis</a> say?</p>
