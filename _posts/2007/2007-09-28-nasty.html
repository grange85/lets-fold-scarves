    That was pretty depressing.  The US looked so good against England, too, that I really thought they could run the table.

    I have to admit that I didn't even really think Brazil would be a threat.  Couldn't have been more wrong about that.  Also, Marta is every bit as good as the hype.

<p><strong>Women's World Cup 2007</strong></p>
<p>I don't think the USA were going to win anyway but this second card for Boxx certainly ended any chances of them beating Brazil. What made me cry (yes, cry) was Cristiane's behaviour. She must have known that she wasn't fouled but that didn't prevent her from holding up two fingers to indicate a supposed second offence and then <em>celebrating</em>. Celebrating! Well, that says goodbye to the sexist nonsense that women footballers are more sporting than the men.</p>
