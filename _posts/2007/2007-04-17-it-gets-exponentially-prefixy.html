<p><strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Long Way Home #2</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure the title is also a reference to how long it'll take to get through the comics. The dialogue is fab but the artwork is variable:  giant Dawn is superbly drawn, the military guys less well, Giles was a bit weedy (not tweedy) looking and that was Amy? I have a problem with Andrew playing any sort of role in the training of the Slayers and Buffy as Sleeping Beauty is hard to stomach (I'd love to say I have faith in Joss Whedon but I didn't have a clue what was going on in <em>Astonishing X-Men: Torn</em>).</p>
<p>Still, Willow is back and is looking like Kate Bush in an homage to Tara's dress in <em>Once More With Feeling</em>.
