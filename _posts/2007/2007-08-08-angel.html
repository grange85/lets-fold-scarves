  content: I must admit, that I love the show basically for what it could have been.
    I really enjoyed the first and last seasons, but the whole middle not so much.
    I adored the characters of Fred, Wesley, Gunn and Lorne, but I usually thought
    Angel and Cordy were, like you said, extremely inconsistent and having of the
    bizarre character development. Nonetheless I hang onto anything Joss with a pretty
    tight grip :)

    It was all a bit of a mess - and the sad thing was that it was a promising idea very badly realised...it should have been funnier and it should have been more consistent...but consistency has been a failing of Angel all along - if the people don't behave in a consistent manner there's no way you can really connect with them.

    Cordy's princess outfit was very silly but I didn't see it as objectionable (and not just because it was Cordy in a metal bikini - at least not as objectionable (or ridiculous) as Leia's bikini that it was undoubtedly a reference to) - it just didn't strike me as gratuitous. I thought she looked quite fetching in the blue outfit she was wearing when she first arrived in Pylea...ok...maybe I should just shut up now!

    As much as I love Lorne, the Pylea arc was a definite misstep. Plus, it brought the oft annoying (at least to me) Fred played by the lovely and talented Amy Acker. Did you watch for Joss Whedon playing Lorne's dancing relative?

    Personally, I think the show begins to hit its stride in season three when Julie Benz proves that despite her performances in season one of <i>Buffy</i> she really can act.

    Leia was a slave at that point and Cordelia was a princess - you know - royal. It was <a href="http://www.ugo.com/images/galleries/girlsofstartrek_girlfriends/jeriryan/jeri_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Seven of Nine</a> all over again.

    And I so didn't want to hear the words "oft annoying" regarding Fred...because she wasn't off to a good start.

<p>I was thinking about the last three episodes of <em>Angel</em>&rsquo;s season two and it occurred to me that my son - my ten year old son - might have enjoyed watching them. And then it occurred to me that is what was wrong with them. This is an adult show that aired after 9 pm and it was like watching a kids&rsquo; show and a poor one at that. I have no objection to another dimension or an alternate universe, I have seen enough <em>Star Trek</em>s in my time so that's not my problem. There is no reason why children should have to put up with an inconsistent plot, stupid dialogue, bizarre character development (yep, Cordy loves her visions) and a lack of logic (yes, Wesley would be in charge because Gunn has no experience in waging battle) just because they are children. Moreover, we shouldn&rsquo;t have to either.</p>
<p>I am getting steadier more and more bewildered at the inconsistency of the series. <em>Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?</em> was an early stand out and when Angel shut the doors on a room full of lawyers in <em>Reunion</em>, I was more than ready for the series to take off. I put up with <em>Happy Anniversary</em> and <em>The Thin Dead Line</em> because nobody's perfect, and even <em>Disharmony</em> didn't make me quake too much and then came <em>Over The Rainbow</em>...</p>
<p>Finally, I do object to Cordelia's costuming: a lot. Joking about it doesn't make it more palatable.</p>
