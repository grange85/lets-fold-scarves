    rel="nofollow">accompanying screencap</a> - you have to have to make it clear
    how important that record is - although Oz ought to have pulled out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/431249763/"

<p><strong>The Harsh Light of Day</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>Spike and Harmony&rsquo;s relationship takes a bit of getting used to and it&rsquo;s a contrast to the Spike and Dru relationship which is more of two equals. Spike is evil, I get that, but he&rsquo;s so rotten and she&rsquo;s so whiny and he kills her and it&rsquo;s not nice.</p>
<p>We have a lot of Parker in this episode and since he is so obviously a creep when you rewatch <em>BtVS</em> it is disturbing to watch Buffy get so close to the mean bastard. And red sheets! See also <em>Surprise</em>, <em>The I in Team</em>, and <em>Seeing Red</em>.</p>
<p>I loved everything about Xander and Anya in this. Anya subtly tells Xander what she wants and the programme makers subtly give us Xander's response as he spurts on the floor. "So, the crux of this plan is&hellip;?" "Sexual intercourse. I've said it like a dozen times." "Uh, huh. Just working through a little hysterical deafness here." "I think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind. Putting you behind me. Behind me figuratively. I'm thinking face to face for the actual event itself." "Ah, right. It's just we hardly know each other. I mean I like you. And you have a certain directness that I admire. <img id="image422" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/harsh-light-of-day.jpg" class="left" alt="Anya and Xander in The Harsh Light of Day" />But sexual interc-- What you're talking about, well--and I'm actually turning into a woman as I say this&hellip;but it's about expressing something. And accepting consequences." "Oh, I have condoms. Some are black." "That's...that's very considerate." "I like you. You're funny, and you're nicely shaped. And frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. Please remove your clothing now." "And the amazing thing...still more romantic than Faith." "Fabric softener."<br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Misc:</p>
<p>Buffy has a scar? Is that in addition to the one the Master gave her?</p>
<p>"I am not enjoying this." "Well, shelve them correctly and we can finish." "I don't get your crazy system." "System? It's called the alphabet." &ndash; the librarian that is me loves this but the librarian that is me wants to know why Giles isn&rsquo;t using Dewey or UDC.</p>
<p>Not content with Willow's clothes they now add insult to injury by making her wear a lurid plaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harmony. A vampire? She must be dying without a reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Okay, either I'm borrowing all your albums or I'm moving in." "Oz, there are more important things than records right now." "More important than this one?" "Well I suppose an argument could be made for&hellip;"</p>
<p>"So what I'm wondering is, does this always happen? Sleep with a guy and he goes all evil." Yep, even Riley is driven off the rails&hellip;or they start evil like Spike and drive us off the rails.</p>
