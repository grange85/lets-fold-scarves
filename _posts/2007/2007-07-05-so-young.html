<p>I'm holding the trophy in the front row. This must have been at least fifteen years ago at Motspur Park. The BBC owned the sports facilities there and they regularly had football tournaments and sports days. This was a sports day not football because we aren't in kits and I don't look like my wrists hurt.</p>
