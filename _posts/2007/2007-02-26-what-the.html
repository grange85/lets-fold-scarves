<p>From the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2021296,00.html">Guardian</a> via <a href="http://modies.blogspot.com/2007/02/for-secular-fundamentalism.html">Shuggy's blog</a> via <a href="http://fiskingcentral.typepad.com/fisking_central/2007/02/fundamentally_w.html">Fisking Central</a>:</p>
<p>"We are witnessing a social phenomenon that is about fundamentalism," says Colin Slee, the Dean of Southwark. "Atheists like the Richard Dawkins of this world are just as fundamentalist as the people setting off bombs on the tube, the hardline settlers on the West Bank and the anti-gay bigots of the Church of England. Most of them would regard each other as destined to fry in hell."</p>
<p>Hmm, is Mr Slee suggesting that any atheist would see anybody in hell? But, more to the point, the day an atheist behaves like any of the others mentioned, hell will have frozen over.</p>
