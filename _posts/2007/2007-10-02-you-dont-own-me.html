  content: I can't believe I'm admitting to having seen this movie in a public forum,
    but my favorite part of <i>The First Wives Club</i> is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwNhV3M8uX0"
    rel="nofollow">Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton performing that song
    at the end.</a> Rasputina has also done a nice cover.

<p>Before yesterday, I knew one song by <a href="http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/People/2005/6/lesleygore.html">Lesley Gore</a>, "It's My Party" (and that was mainly because it was covered by Barbara Gaskin and Dave Stewart in the 80s) and it has commonplace boo-hoo lyrics like "I'll Cry Instead". So I wasn't impressed when on <em><a href="http://www.learmedia.ca/product_info.php/products_id/1202">The T.A.M.I. Show</a></em> from 1964 she first sang "Maybe I Know" with the lyrics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe I know that he's been a cheating<br />
Maybe I know that he's been untrue<br />
But what can I do?</blockquote></p>
<p>but the next song "You Don't Own Me" was a revelation (and a real grower).</p>

<blockquote><p>You don't own me, I'm not just one of your many toys<br />
You don't own me, don't say I can't go with other boys</p>
<p>And don't tell me what to do<br />
And don't tell me what to say<br />
And please, when I go out with you<br />
Don't put me on display, 'cause</p>
<p>You don't own me, don't try to change me in any way<br />
You don't own me, don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay</p>
<p>Oh, I don't tell you what to say<br />
I don't tell you what to do<br />
So just let me be myself<br />
That's all I ask of you</p>
<p>I'm young and I love to be young<br />
I'm free and I love to be free<br />
To live my life the way I want<br />
To say and do whatever I please</blockquote></p>
