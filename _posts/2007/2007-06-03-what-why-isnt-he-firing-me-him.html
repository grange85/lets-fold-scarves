<p><strong>The Replacement</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>This is Xander&rsquo;s <em>Dopplegangland</em>. And while it is not the classic that <em>DGL</em> is, it is certainly a well made episode with great performances from Nicholas Brendon (and his twin brother, Kelly). It takes a while to get up to steam but the last ten minutes are hilarious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Dawn. You gave her a headache.&rdquo; &ldquo;I did not! Did I give you a headache, Mom? I'm sure part of it is Buffy's.&rdquo; &ldquo;But part of it is Dawn's.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's so nice you've learned to share. You girls, sort this out yourselves. It's good for you.&rdquo; (sob)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image562" src="/images/uploads/2007/06/the-replacement-spike-and-the-mannequin.jpg" alt="The Replacement - Spike and the mannequin" /></div><br />
Spike and the mannequin. It was funny when I first saw it but I was innocent then.</p>
<p>"Right. There comes a point where you either have to move on, or just buy yourself a Klingon costume and...go with it."</p>
<p>Anya&rsquo;s pyjamas. Just...no way.</p>

And in the same episode that Buffy's hair looks this nice.</p>

She wears a <a href="http://www.walls.co.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?choosenProductID=262&choosenSubCategory=58&choosenTopCategory=1&pageID=815&alias=uk&lang=en&bgName=&flashPath=walls_logo.swf">Neapolitan ice cream</a> inspired top and these (shudder) trousers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtUqGSrsxBE">Snoopy dance</a>: forever imprinted as the sweetest Xander moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never help. I get in trouble and Buffy saves me.&rdquo; &ldquo;That's not true! Sometimes we all helped save you. And sometimes you're not in trouble.&rdquo; (examples please!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, wait till you have an evil twin. See how you handle it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I handled it fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xander&rsquo;s conversation with Anya makes me very cross, even though <em>Hell&rsquo;s Bells</em> is a long way off.</p>
<p>I was moaning to Andy (after <em>Out of My Mind</em>) about the evidence to prove that that Buffy doesn&rsquo;t love Riley and, oops, here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Riley, do you wish&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;No? You don't even know what I was gonna say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I do. You wanted to know if I wished you got hit by the ferula-gemina, got split in two.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you have been kind of rankly about the whole slayer gig. Instead of having slayer Buffy, you could have Buffy Buffy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey. I have Buffy Buffy. Being the slayer's part of who you are. You keep thinking I don't get that, but...&rdquo; &ldquo;It's just ... I know how ... un-fun it can be. The bad hours, frequent bruising, cranky monsters...&rdquo; &ldquo;Buffy... if you led a perfectly normal life, you wouldn't be half as crazy as you are. I gotta have that. I gotta have it all. I'm talkin' toes, elbows, the whole bad-ice-skating-movie obsession, everything. There's no part of you I'm not in love with.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Riley, Anya owns a gun?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ...huh. It is kinda cool. Washington's still there, but he's all smushy. And he may be Jefferson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This joke is done again and again (I mean, the Giles&rsquo; distaste) but funny:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well, maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away. See, I can take the boys home, and ... we can all have sex together, and ... you know, just slap 'em back together in the morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;She's joking.&rdquo; &ldquo;No she's not! She entirely wants to have sex with us together. Which is ...wrong, and, and it would be very confusing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, uh, we just need to light the candles. Also, we should continue to pretend we heard none of the disturbing sex talk.&rdquo;<br />
</blockquote></p>

&ldquo;What'll we do if this doesn't work?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kill us both, Spock!&rdquo; &ldquo;They're...kinda the same now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he's clearly a bad influence on himself.&rdquo; The look on "their" faces as they realise what they said is priceless.</p>
