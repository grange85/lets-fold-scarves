<p><strong>Primeval</strong> (David Fury)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on record that season four is my favourite but I think I was mistaking a whole buncha good episodes for a good <em>series</em> of episodes. It didn&rsquo;t help that Professor Walsh departed rather abruptly which lead to Adam taking centre stage which made season 4&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bad">big bad</a> a big bore.</p>
<p>Feel free to skip the following witterings: I&rsquo;m fairly confident that seasons 5, 6 and 7 won&rsquo;t be my favourite seasons so it&rsquo;s now between 2 and 3. My first thought is 3 because of Faith and the Mayor but then I remember <em>Dead Man&rsquo;s Party</em> and <em>Beauty and the Beasts</em>. Then I remember <em>Bad Eggs</em> and <em>Killed by Death</em>. Then I remember <em>Amends</em>, <em>Helpless</em> and <em>The Zeppo</em> and then I remember <em>Inca Mummy Girl</em>, <em>Reptile Boy</em>, and <em>Go Fish</em>. So do Faith and the Mayor beat Kendra and Angelus? Does preaching beat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_of_the_week">MOTW</a> episodes? I think I may in danger of getting great episodes like <em>Innocence</em>/<em>Surprise</em>, <em>Phases</em>, <em>Passion</em> and <em>Becoming I</em> and <em>II</em> mixed up with a great season and as much as I hate <em>DMP</em> and <em>BATB</em> with a passion there are few routine episodes and the others I mentioned have much to recommend them (except, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, <em>The Zeppo</em>). Season 3 is my favourite.</p>

I think this is the poorest finale of all <em>BtVS</em> seasons with its <em>X-Files</em> lite coda summing up the crappiness of the idea of the Initiative. I was surprised to see the military turning up in Season 8; did Joss not learn anything? (<em>Restless</em> isn&rsquo;t really the finale in the truest sense.)</p>
<p>Zombie Walsh and zombie Forrest are just horrible while Riley ripping out his chip (which just remember is directly attached to his nervous system) is plain daft.</p>

However, the true power of the Scoobies is harnessed and it is genuinely moving to see them working together.</p>

Buffy and Willow&rsquo;s chat in the lift shaft is sweet but really: &ldquo;Let's promise to never not talk again.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;So what if they are?  You're a good person, and a good boyfriend, and...and I'm in love with you.  Whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter.&rdquo; Anya is so lovable (and sensible) when she&rsquo;s allowed to be, well, human.</p>
