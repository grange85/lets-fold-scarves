    Indeed, Adam was the lamest evil thing ever (with the possible exception of Kennedy).
    Is it just me, or is there something about Giles' pronunciation of "Wagnerian" that's just sexy somehow?

<p><strong>Goodbye Iowa</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>Riley is confused and is going cold turkey: all he understood has been ripped up and scattered: he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Michty me, Adam was dull wasn&rsquo;t he? I do believe I may have elided him from my memory along with season five&rsquo;s knights.</p>
<p>Emma Caulfield is a joy to listen to:  Buffy; &ldquo;Maggie tried to kill me.&rdquo; Anya: &ldquo;It didn't work but they're all upset anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene in the basement as morning comes is classic ensemble BtVS:  the Wile E. Coyote comments (&ldquo;That would never happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, no Buff. That's why they call them cartoons, not documentaries.&rdquo;), Giles and Anya bitching (&ldquo;Well, look who's cranky bear in the morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I can't imagine why I didn't sleep well in my beach ball.&rdquo; <img id="image486" src="/images/uploads/2007/04/goodbye-iowa-three-in-a-bed.jpg" class="left" alt="Goodbye Iowa - three in a bed - Willow, Anya and Buffy" />&ldquo;Every time you moved it made squeaky noises. It was irritating.&rdquo; &ldquo;Really? I'm surprised you could hear it over your Wagnerian snoring.&rdquo;), Anya&rsquo;s possessiveness over Xander and Buffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;yummy sushi pajamas" speech.</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s bandana: why?
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image484" src="/images/uploads/2007/04/s-bandana.jpg" alt="Goodbye Iowa - Buffy's bandanna" /></div></p>
<p>Andy was chortling over this: &ldquo;No, you don't have to explain. I don't mind, really. I've been thinking about that last spell we did...all day.&rdquo; Chortling: like Xander in <em>Restless</em>.</p>
<p>Xander&rsquo;s military experience sure was handier than Buffy&rsquo;s helpless lady but the scriptwriters via Anya at least make us realise it&rsquo;s a smidgeon silly: &ldquo;He's the only one with military experience.&rdquo; &ldquo;It's not like he was in the 'Nam. He was G.I. Joe for one night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tara does a daft and dangerous thing but I&rsquo;ll discuss that and the second daft thing she does when I get to <em>Family</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the jokes are tasteless (and not very plausible, Xander the guy who reads comics wouldn&rsquo;t know retinal?): &ldquo;Sorry. I'm the only one that can pass the retinal scan.&rdquo; &ldquo;The&hellip; ewww. I don't want to see that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Retinal scan, Xander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why she was wearing that bandana so Riley can wrap the grubby thing around his wounded hand in a military hospital.</p>
