    Man, this is hard. All the songs with appropriate lyrics are too slow or too sweet and all the songs with the right tempo have somewhat inappropriate lyrics...

    Thanks for the suggestions. I could only find two of the songs and even though neither worked for the video I like both "Recovery" and "This Is What It Is" very much. It's funny -- I almost used "It's True" by New Buffalo for the Tara video.

    Perfectly snobby!

    However, I'm a bit rubbish at recommending songs on a <i>theme</i>...

    The only really sexual song I can think of is <i>Let's Get Lost</i> by Tina Dico which is overwrought and intense.

    Otherwise I can recommend songs that I like and would <i>love</i> to hear on a video. Like <i>Recovery</i> by New Buffalo, <i>Ginger</i> by Lovers, <i>Heroine</i> by Ruby Falls, <i>This Is What It Is</i> by Nina Nastasia, <i>Blue Light Room</i> by Tara Jane O'Neil. Finally, the lyrics of <i>Superball</i> by Aimee Mann describes AB for me:

    "I'm a superball
    You can bounce me once and I ricochet
    Around the room
    I'm a superball
    If I pick up speed get out of my way
    I'm a sonic boom

    And I warn you now
    The velocity I'm gathering
    Will knock you down
    Send the chairs and lamps all scattering", etc

    Any Aimee would be great or Paula Frazer...

    Apparently I'm in a video-making mood because I've begun collecting clips for an Amber Benson video, but I'm stuck on which song to use. You seem to like some of the same artists that I do and seem to know the difference between crap and, you know, music. (Did that sound snobby enough?) So I'm soliciting your opinion.

    Currently I'm using Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's "Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away" as kind of a temporary track because it has a good middle-of-the-road tempo, but the lyrics seem a little off. And I feel like Amber needs a strong, female artist who doesn't gloss over sex in her lyrics, like PJ Harvey or Liz Phair, but I haven't found a song that seems to fit. So I suppose this is a long way to ask the question, can you think of a song or songs that you think capture Amber's personality? I would appreciate any suggestions.

    Are you talking about the 'Advisory Committee' album cover? I never thought about it like that...

    And, yeah, I hate how most of the Willow/Tara videos on YouTube have these melodramatic, typically BAD pop songs. If I see another person use Tatu's "All The Things You Said" I'm gonna... Well, I'm not sure what I'll do, but it won't be pleasant.

    I like female singers like Tara Jane O'Neil, Paula Frazer, Lovers, Aimee Mann, Barbara Manning, Lois, etc, who just all happen to be on independent labels and doing their own thing. What struck me about your video is the song (and the great clips) when usually it's Evanescence and Celine Dion :-)

    As for Mirah, how can you not like an artist who puts what looks like, erm, a muff on an album cover?

    for a new album. The remixes just aren't enough to tide me over.
