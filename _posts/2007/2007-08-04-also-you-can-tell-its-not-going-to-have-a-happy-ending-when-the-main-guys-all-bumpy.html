    one of the funny parts was when spike commented something about all 3 women (dru, buffy and harmony) completely frustrating and ganging up on him. With 2 of the 3 tied up, he was still no match for the women. hahaha!

    he was helpless and hopeless in love and this too when he was soulless. Between spike and angel, i wonder who really deserved to to become human again, one who was good out of love/choice (and soulless) or one who had a soul.

<p><strong>Crush</strong> (<a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/caps/albums/Series/Buffy/Buf_S6/Buf_607/omwf_167.jpg">David Fury</a>)</p>
<p>Buffy and Dru are restrained, Harmony lurks around, <em>Spike talks a lot</em>, Buffy slams the door in his face.</p>
<p>Well, that's it, isn't it? Spike talks a lot about himself and if you care then this is a great episode.</p>
<p>It opens with hilarious dancing - first, Anya with the typical hands over the head grooving and then Willow and Tara's..., I don't know, it's sort of dancing, swaying and holding hands, and funny.</p>
<p>"I'm down with that. Let's just call "she who will not be named" another name. Let's just call her-" "Ben!" (well, it made me laugh)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image660" src="/images/uploads/2007/08/s-disgust.jpg" alt="Crush - Buffy's disgust" /></div>I did enjoy the part when Buffy realises that Dawn is right and Spike is crushing on her. "Is this a date?" she asks incredulously and Spike can't wriggle out of it.</p>
<p>"What, that chip in your head? That's not change. That's just...holding you back. You're like a serial killer in prison!" "Women marry them all the time!"</p>
<p>The last time Harmony is funny: "Or Charlize Theron."</p>
<p>"Honey, did you...somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Uh, send him signals?" "Well, I...I do beat him up a lot. For Spike that's like third base." (of course, it's the victim's fault that they are being stalked)</p>
<p>Well, that was as pathetic a review as this cardigan cruelty:</p>
