<p>I read several days ago about the murder of Du&rsquo;a Khalil Aswad and the video that a man had taken of the event but I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to watch it. However, the mistake I then made was to push the matter away and do nothing. It took a post from Joss Whedon on <a href="http://whedonesque.com/comments/13271">Whedonesque</a> to remind myself of it and do a small <a href="http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk">something</a> about a <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/">world</a> in which some men hate some women because they are women.</p>
<p>*Germaine Greer in <em>The Female Eunuch</em> in the chapter <em>Loathing and Disgust</em> (I suspect Du'a knew in the last hideous thirty minutes of her life).</p>
<p>ETA: <a href="http://blog.shrub.com/archives/tekanji/2005-11-22_72">this</a> is great because it's true. You could play feminist <a href="http://girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/index.php?entry=entry070415-071159">bingo</a> with this.</p>
