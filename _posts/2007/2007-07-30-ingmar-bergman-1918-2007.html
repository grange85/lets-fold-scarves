<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image651" src="/images/uploads/2007/07/the-seventh-seal.jpg" alt="The Seventh Seal" /></div>Andy and I recently watched <em>The Seventh Seal</em>, he for the first time and I for the first time in several years, and it was amazing: deeply symbolic, dense and multi-layered with two extraordinarily moving scenes (the burning at stake and Death at the castle) but at the same time accessible and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Unlike <em>Persona</em>, which although entirely gripping, left me with the humbling feeling that I didn't actually understand any of it.</p>
