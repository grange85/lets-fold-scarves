<p><strong>I Only Have Eyes For You</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>I seem to be a minority regarding this episode because I don&rsquo;t like it much. I do get the themes about blaming yourself and forgiveness but I&rsquo;m not clear what the arm in the locker, the snakes in the canteen (except a foreshadowing relating to the mayor) or the various happenings during the spell have to do with the re-enactments of the doomed relationship between <a href="http://www.christophergorham.com/">Henry</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089385/">Natty Gann</a>.</p>
<p>In a DVD extra, Joss Whedon says that David Boreanaz&rsquo;s performance in the scene between Buffy and Angel when they are possessed made him realise that DB could carry a series of his own. I do like SMG&rsquo;s work but her performance in this scene wouldn&rsquo;t have suggested to me that she could carry a series.</p>
<p>Giles&rsquo; delusion is hard to watch and the moment when he accepts the truth (&ldquo;Jenny could never be this mean&rdquo;) is moving. It&rsquo;s also a shame to introduce Ms Calendar&rsquo;s potentially useful rose quartz and have the idea go nowhere and, <em>grr argh</em>, to the computer stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People can be coerced, Summers. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK. I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of the puzzle. And I'm gonna look at all the pieces carefully and rationally, and I'm gonna keep looking until I know exactly how this is all your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.&rdquo;</p>
