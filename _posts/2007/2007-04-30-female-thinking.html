I&rsquo;ve decided to change the name of my <em>How am I different</em> category to <em>Female thinking</em> because it&rsquo;s a more accurate reflection of the contents. I don&rsquo;t really know what the Aimee Mann song is about, plus, "Female thinking" is ironic because it&rsquo;s what Bill Hickok says to Calamity Jane when she&rsquo;s mooning over some stuffed shirt (the worst thing about <em>CJ</em> is the wooden (stuffed and wooden?) Philip Carey). I have loved and enjoyed <em>Calamity Jane</em> for many years but only recently has my attention been drawn to the entirely lesbian interpretation that can be brought to it. <em>A Woman&rsquo;s Touch</em> indeed.<br /></p>

Howard Keel who made me swoon as Clayton Farlow in <em>Dallas</em> (I know, I know, but old Sean Connery is a handsome devil too) has been in three films with exceedingly questionable sexist attitudes : <em>Calamity Jane</em>, <em>Kiss Me Kate</em> and <em>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</em> (I reckon the latter set the ball rolling for feminism) but I forgive him because of that rumbling baritone and those tights in <em>Kiss Me Kate</em>.

I must mention a couple of blogs that have caught my attention. The first I came across today which is the wonderful riposte to the vile and abominable <em>Observer Woman</em> monthly magazine which is an insult to women everywhere. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://spittingmadwoman.blogspot.com/">Observer Woman Makes Me Spit</a> which says it all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have to love anybody&rsquo;s blog whose About Me says &ldquo;I'm a misanthropic humanist. While I'm a do-gooder by training and profession, I sort of also loathe people.&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s more! The very funny Suzanne Reisman is the founder of <a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/">CUSS</a> which is not the most attractive of acronyms but I'm a CUSS supporter. As she says "<a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/2005/10/why-world-needs-pubic-hair.html">Feline pussies with fur are nice to stroke. Hairless cats are freaky.</a>" She also wrote this very good article on being <a href="http://ny.metro.us/metro/blog/my_view/entry/I_will_never_be_a_Mrs_husband/5279.html">Mrs. Husband</a>: "It is strange to me that a woman would invest so much time in her education and work life, building a reputation and accruing respect for her achievements under one identity, and then suddenly become (sort of) someone else."</p>
