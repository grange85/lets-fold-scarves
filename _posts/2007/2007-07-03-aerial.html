    The "Can you untie me please?" line made me laugh out loud when I watched the trailer. That film looks....interesting. I'm glad that Amber is getting to play some roles that are more sexual beings since Willow and Tara were so often desxualized on <i>Buffy</i>.

    Judging from the trailer, I expect <i>Simple Things</i> to be simply clich&#38;eacute;ed, but Amber seems to be doing some really good work right now so I'm eager to see her performance.

    That was an unadulterated photo taken from an upstairs window. We have had the wettest June (and probably July too) since at least 1914 and I took the picture during a a  thunderstorm over west London. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/753756053/" rel="nofollow">This</a rel="nofollow"> is a photo from today.

    "Can you untie me please?"

    I received and watched <i>Simple Things</i> this weekend. I think "simple things" = cliches but Amber was great.

    Something I've been wondering -- is that picture in grayscale or is the sky actually that color?

    Also, you may have already seen this, but I just found the <a href="http://web.mac.com/joelviertel/iWeb/Site/STRICTLY%20SEXUAL%20Trailer_files/STRICTLY%20Trailer%20v1.mp4" rel="nofollow">trailer</a> for one of Amber's to-be released movies, <i>Strictly Sexual</i>.
