<p>Oh my, this started off okay if a little cheesily but slowly deteriorated into a pile of sentimental slush that was sometimes unbearable to watch. Spartakos, a guest blogger over at the <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.info/">Hathor Legacy</a> has analysed the relationships in the film but is far too kind in not actually saying the film itself is execrable. Her views on the <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.info/love-actually-part-4/">Colin</a> and <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.info/love-actually-part-3/">Sarah</a> stories are particularly good. May I take this opportunity to say that Emma Thompson was awesome as was Bill Nighy and I did laugh quite often because this is Richard &ldquo;Blackadder&rdquo; Curtis but otherwise, yuck!</p>
