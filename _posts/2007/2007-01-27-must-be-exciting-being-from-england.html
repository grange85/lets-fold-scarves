<p>Band Candy (<a href="http://www.janeespenson.com/">Jane Espenson</a>)</p>
<p><img id="image302" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/snyder.jpg" class="left" alt="Snyder in Band Candy" />I enjoyed this episode but I've found it hard to find a lot of quotable dialogue. It builds up nicely as the behaviour of the adults  deteriorates. It is very well done and they have so much fun: Tony Head and, perhaps, Armin Shimerman the most.<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Buffy and her SATs are so annoying. She clearly couldn&rsquo;t have possibly got the scores she did get: &ldquo;B. I'm going with B. We haven't had B in forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I'm looking forward to it. I do well on standardized tests. What? I can't have layers?&rdquo; &ndash; well no Cordy, not after you split up from Xander</p>
<p>Giles being hit on the head by a ball is funny but Buffy lying to her mum and Giles isn&rsquo;t. And the scenes with Angel, snore.</p>
<p>Willow and Xander playing footsie under the table is plain wrong.</p>
<p>I had forgotten how naff the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingoes_Ate_My_Baby">Dingoes</a> were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They're acting like a bunch...&rdquo; &ldquo;They're acting like a bunch of us.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't act like this.&rdquo; (flash to <em>All the Way</em>: "It's where I'd be if I were fifteen and on the lam." "Really?" "Well, not me at fifteen, 'cause, hello, spaz." "You?" "Yeah. Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama came from humble, geek-infested roots")</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sooo cool. You're like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>.&rdquo;<img id="image303" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/rupert-and-joyce.jpg" alt="Rupert and Joyce" /></p>
