    You are so spot on about the Buffy fantasy deal. In fact I don't think that would be the fantasy of any of the three of them. So whose fantasy is it? Several thousand fans, I'm guessing :) Sigh.
    I had the "oh thank god, Kennedy's out of the picture" thought, too. Ugh.
    Nonetheless, I'm pathetically waiting with baited breath for the next episode...

<p><strong>Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Long Way Home #3</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image506" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/buffy-803.jpg" alt="Buffy 8.03 Willow and Amy" /></div><br />
A few thoughts:</p>
<p>Ethan Rayne looks like Nathan Fillion as Caleb (at least in the first panel).</p>
<p>My eye while looking at the image of Buffy with Angel and Spike is caught not by the nudity but by the fact that Buffy is in a nurse&rsquo;s uniform and suspenders which doesn't strike me as a woman's fantasy (but what do I know? see later).</p>
<p>Pixellating Willow, Willow has blue eyes, Willow says "bone a thricewise", say what?</p>
<p>Tara is in the cube on the bottom left and that is Joyce atop Faith (this must sound kinky to the uninitiated).</p>
<p>Any panel with Andrew in it is a wasted panel, rather like season seven when any scene with Andrew in it meant less screen time for characters I actually cared about. There is no offence intended to the actor because it's the character that sucks. And the strip poker panel is just lame and offensive.</p>
<p>I do have problems that these not particularly bright men (except Giles) are directing the actions of hundreds of women. I'm not exactly getting a feminism vibe yet.</p>
<p>As for the dead Kennedy misdirect I was genuinely shocked when I read that. Firstly because I was made to feel guiltily happy that Kennedy was out of the picture, and secondly, I was appalled that Willow now had two dead girlfriends. It wasn&rsquo;t funny, it&rsquo;s baiting Tara fans and Kennedy detractors (not always one and the same thing) and it&rsquo;s mean Jossing.</p>
<p>Willow fancied Xander (and Malcolm) and actually had sex with a very stubbly guy called Oz. I&rsquo;m happy that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;gay now&rdquo; but please stop with the suggestions that Willow was only marginally interested in guys.</p>
<p>Oh blimey, this sounds like I hated it but I didn't, I enjoyed it a lot: it was the best issue so far. However, the dissection that goes on the net makes me rather jealous I couldn't do the same for the TV series.</p>
<p>Which brings me to <a href="http://capitalismbad.blogspot.com/2007/02/now-im-all-nervous-again.html">this criticism</a> of the cover by Jo Chen which reminds me of my first reaction which was "gosh, look at those". I am conflicted because yes, Willow's boobs are bigger than before (maybe she's pregnant?) but at the same time I love it. I'm not a man and if she is drawn for men then it's worked on me too. However, I do agree with a commentator (Ravenwing263) who criticises Chen for her portrayal of Gert as far from dumpy.</p>
