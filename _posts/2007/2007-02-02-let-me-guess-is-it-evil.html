    On the "touching" thing - surely it is only touching if the person being touched feels it and I'm not convinced there is any feeling.

    Lisa: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?

    Bart: Absolutely!  [makes the sound of a tree falling]

    Lisa: But Bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it.

    Bart: Wooooooo...

    Does it sort of worry you that I sneer at any historical/archaeological assumption but can pretty much explain every anomaly in the Whedonverse?

    I will never cease to be flummoxed by the fact that everyone is talking about how hot it is while wearing coats.

    And Buffy's hair was just appalling. Almost as bad as David Boreanaz's accent.

<p><strong>Amends </strong>(Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>The bad hair and bad wig and bad ending fairies all paid a visit to this episode. Luckily the good Willow/Oz scene fairy was also on hand (twice).</p>
<p>First, someone's scissors must have slipped because Buffy's hair at various times through this episode is a horror.</p>
<p>Cordelia (or should I say Charisma) is shoved on for one of her (presumably obligatory contractual) appearances and she is just so bitchy and season one that I am pissed off with JW for doing this to her.</p>
<p>Oz and Willow make up and there's a "can you just be kissing me now?" moment or something like that ("do you want us to... to hug now?").</p>
<p><img id="image321" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/jenny-as-the-first.jpg" class="left" alt="The First as Jenny" />Angel is haunted and he's really quite good in these scenes (but not in the be-wigged flashbacks because nobody can act past that accent and those wigs). A visit from Jenny is always nice because Robia LaMorte is a pleasure to look at but The First seems to do an awful lot of touching "<a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?op=article&article_id=988906#top">No touching!</a>").<br clear="all"></p>
<p>The scene at Willy's bar with Xander being all "threatening" is a cringer.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be really hot but never does anyone look hot (except Jenny and Faith but that's a different hot) and that is not good direction or costuming (and we know that is often not good).</p>
<p>Willow tempts Oz but as usual Oz is far too sensible for a teen and says no, we'll wait until <em>I'm</em> ready, I mean, <em>we are</em>. Actually, this scene is the highlight of the episode with the bottle of fizzy drink in the cooler, the whole <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=3XCZ3C0tuyB&sa=X&oi=music&ct=result">Barry</a> thing working, Willow looking lovely and Oz being so damn sensible.</p>
<p>I think the scene on the hill is very powerful with some top acting but just as it's getting somewhere it bloody snows.</p>
<p>"Well, it must be that whole Angel killed his girlfriend and tortured him thing. Hey, Giles is pretty petty when it comes to stuff like that." (Please. When do I get to like Xander again?)</p>
<p>"Hello, still Jewish." (yes, we know, and we know you were gay in season five too)</p>
<p>""A child shall be born of man and goat and have two heads, and The First shall speak only in riddles" No wonder you like this stuff. It's like reading the Sun." (not <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29">The Sun</a></em> but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_%28supermarket_tabloid%29"><em>Sun</em></a>)</p>
<p>"Hmm. You think you can fight me? I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The First Evil. Beyond sin, beyond death. I am the thing the darkness fears. You'll never see me, but I am everywhere. Every being, every thought, every drop of hate." "All right, I get it. You're evil. Do we have to chat about it all day?" "Angel will be dead by sunrise. Your Christmas will be his wake." "No." "You have no idea what you're dealing with." "Let me guess. Is it evil?"</p>
<p>"I know. I can smell the sunrise long before it comes." (this line is meaningless if you think too hard about it)</p>
