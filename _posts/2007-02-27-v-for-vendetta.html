<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image365" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/v-for-vendetta.jpg" alt="Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta" /></div><br clear="all"/>Having just finished the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/V-Vendetta-Alan-Moore/dp/1852862912/sr=8-2/qid=1172536778/ref=pd_ka_2/202-7278277-2103812?ie=UTF8&s=books">graphic novel</a> it was perhaps a mistake to view the film so soon after. It is hard to separate novel from adaptation without just sounding like a whinger but, whatever, the film is a failure.</p>
<p>Some changes are inevitable in any adaptation but when so many are made you think what's the point in even bothering? <em>V for Vendetta</em> is crying out to be made as a tv series.</p>
<p>Natalie Portman was fine as long as you accept the change in her character from match factory girl so desperate that's she willing to prostitute herself to middle-class already radicalized white collar worker. I'm not convinced she would risk so much at the beginning for an evening meal with Deitrich though. Additionally, I don't believe she would sell out V to a paedophile priest (no matter how suspicious she was of V); there was a clue, Evey, in the child's clothes you were wearing that the priest wasn't quite trustworthy.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of this film is spoilt because I am British but all those cosy middle class families watching tv while the working classes were darn the pub was annoying: isn't The Royle Family on BBC America?</p>
<p>The film fell apart in the last half an hour: V was no superhero and "knife time" was just stupid. I know V had been preparing his attack for several years but I'd like to know how he mass produced all those masks. Finch's "I went to Larkhill" was totally shoe-horned in and made no sense. As well as mass producing masks, V also managed to lay some underground train tracks and make invisible fireworks and demolition material for the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>The best part of the film was the torture of Evey and the story of Valerie which coincidently enough was the part of the film most faithful to the novel...</p>
<p>Still, it wasn't all bad: my favourite moment is that Evey's first complaint after realising who tortured her was to say "you cut my hair" and, oh yeah, "you tortured me".</p>
