<p><em>Mallory brings out a camera from one of the cupboards.</em></p>
<p>MALLORY: This is a 35mm camera. Now my suggestion is you&rsquo;re starting out is just to set it on auto and that way you-</p>
<p>VERONICA: I&rsquo;d really be more comfortable if I could just use my own camera.</p>
<p><em>Veronica pulls a serious camera out of her bag</em>.</p>
<p>VERONICA: Um, the swivel LCD really comes in handy when you&rsquo;re doing overhead shooting or ground level macro-shooting.</p>
<p>MALLORY: [Bemused] Right.</p>
<p>VERONICA: The optical zoom actually goes up to 71.2mm and it&rsquo;s good to have the raw file option because you can mess with the images post-exposure without nearly the loss of image quality you&rsquo;d get with a JPEG file.</p>
<p>MALLORY: And&hellip; when it&rsquo;s dark outside, you should-you should use a flash.</p>
<p><em>They both laugh and Mallory puts the simple camera back in the cupboard.</em></p>
