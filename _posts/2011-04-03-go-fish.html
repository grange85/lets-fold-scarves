<p>Rather like the monsters in the boys&#39; bodies, there is a great episode struggling to come out of this one. It tries to deal with male entitlement and victim blaming but as far as I am concerned it fails miserably to do those subjects justice. Plus, I don&#39;t want <i>Buffy</i> to teach me anything unless it&#39;s about friendship, loyalty and never to wear what Willow&nbsp; wears. If you ignore the episode&#39;s failures then it&#39;s not so bad: great dialogue as usual and Cordelia gives us a lovely heartfelt moment that Xander does not deserve when she is so upset when she thinks he has turned into a monster.<br></p>
