<p><strong>The Dark Age</strong> (Dean Batali and Rob Des Hotel)</p>
<p>An episode about Giles&rsquo;s past and I can barely remember any of it (that's before checking the <a href="http://www.buffyworld.com/buffy/season2/transcripts/20_tran.shtml">transcript</a>, of course). Jenny and Giles&rsquo; relationship hits the buffers in this which is a shame because Jenny&rsquo;s teasing of Giles is a pleasure. However, her reluctance to get over it is highly understandable and good work by the programme makers.</p>
<p>Anywhere but here: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.brns.com/pages/yiprev.html">Amy Yip</a> at the waterslide park&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was home alone drinking?&rdquo; &ldquo;But, tea, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he seemed perfectly normal yesterday when I saw him talking to the police&rdquo; &ldquo;And you waited till now to tell us this because?&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn't think it was important&rdquo; &ldquo;We understand. It wasn't about you&rdquo; - the tension between Cordy and Xander is rising!</p>
<p>Ethan has a droll touch: &ldquo;You sold me that dress for Halloween, and nearly got us all killed!&rdquo; &ldquo;But you looked great&rdquo; and the not so droll &ldquo;Now, this may sting a little just at first. But don't worry, that'll go away once the searing pain kicks in&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's complicated, Buffy, and quite frankly, it's private&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't care from private! I care from dead guys attacking us. I care from you <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/lostw.html">lost weekending</a> in your apartment&rdquo; (as much as I love BtVS dialogue, I can&rsquo;t see Buffy being a big Ray Milland fan)</p>
<p>Again, Buffy is felled with one blow &ndash; grr to this inconsistency.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/images/D/D3046.jpg">Not large with the butch</a>?: &ldquo;Hey! We don't have time for this! Our friends are in trouble! Now, we have to put our heads together and, and get them out of it! And if you two aren't with me a hundred and ten percent, then get the hell out of my library!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/baycityrollers.htm">Bay City Rollers</a>. Now, that's music&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn't hear that&rdquo; - neither did we</p>
