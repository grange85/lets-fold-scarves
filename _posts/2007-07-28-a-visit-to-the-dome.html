  content: While I enjoy Scissor Sisters, or at least their self-titled album, I'm
    not sure I quite understand... What's with the lesbian references in their name?
    Of course, there's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribadism"
    rel="nofollow">scissor sisters</a>, but their original name was Dead Lesbian
    and the Fibrillating Scissor Sisters.

    pretty much covered what I was going to say about last week's Aimee Mann concert,
    on her blog Let's Fold Scarves so this is mostly just a post of agreement.  I
    hate to be so negative about a venue but there really is almost nothing to like
    about the Dome. As far as I could tell they've squeezed two live music venues
    and an ugly &#38;#34;high street&#38;#34; into it and forgot to include any charm,
    any comfort, any atmosphere or anything to make you feel that you'd want to go
    back.  We were up in the gods of the smaller of the two venues - the air conditioning
    had failed and so rather than squeeze into our hot seats and fidget uncomfortably,
    we sat around the back of the venue which was a bit more airy. The sound was good
    (although the incessant buzzing from the blue neon lights around the venue was
    annoying) and the view, considering how far away and high up we were was not too
    bad (there was a big screen but it was positioned so that the only people who
    could see it were those close enough to not need it!).  The place had absolutely
    no atmosphere - maybe it was better closer to the front although I'd be surprised,
    it gave me the feeling that we were watching a video rather than at a gig. Aimee
    Mann was very good, and while I think the venue was the main reason for the listless
    show, I can't help feeling that she didn't seem to have the will to get things
    going, her smooth banter and charming fuck-ups were unable to inject any much
    needed life into the show.  The boat ride home along the Thames was a buzz and
    infinitely preferable to the Jubilee line! [...]"

<p><strong>Aimee Mann at Indigo2</strong></p>

<p>The Dome was a mass of humanity particularly along Entertainment Avenue. It was like <em>Blade Runner</em> but without the rain: thoroughly depressing. The Scissor Sisters were also playing in the Arena and there was a disappointing lack of outrageous clothing and campiness.</p>
<p>Aimee Mann was as accomplished as all the live performances I have downloaded suggested she would be. She was pleasantly rude about Posh and Becks, charmingly forgot her lyrics and concluded with the "I have never played this live before", <em>Superball</em>. The sound was superb and yet the venue was lifeless. It might have been different in the stalls but up in gods it was lacking in any atmosphere. There was no excitement, no anticipation, no squeals of recognition when a song began, just polite applause. There is no way I'd go there again. No amount of being able to see properly makes up for the thrill of <em>feeling</em> the atmosphere of Espers at the Bush Hall even though I couldn't see Meg and Helena at all.</p>

So sadly, the highlight of my evening wasn't Aimee but the journey back to Waterloo on a catamaran. It was drizzling, it was chilly, it was fabulous: racing down the Thames watching commerce and history go by. The boat was full to capacity and buzzing with excitement unlike the O2.</p>
