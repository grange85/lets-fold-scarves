The Trouble with Harry reminded me of an episode of one of Hitchcock's TV series with higher production values. That's not a compliment. The cast were lovely. I doubt that the audiences of the fifties wondered where Arnie was most of the time but I did. I prefer Hitchcock to make funny films not actual comedies.
