<p>I (shamelessly) couldn't resist copying <a href="http://laughingwild.blogspot.com/2008_03_01_archive.html#7632805150214815347">maurinsky</a>.</p>
<p>Below are quotes from fifteen of my favourite films. The oldest film is from 1937, the newest is from 1997. One film is in German.</p>
<p>1.	You've come back and caught me in the truth, and there's nothing less logical than the truth. <strong>Screwball comedy from 1937</strong></p>
<p>2.	May I congratulate you on the birth of Christ. <strong>Notable for its cinematography and set design - British</strong></p>
<p>3.	I'm the Wienie King! Invented the Texas Wienie! Lay off 'em, you'll live longer. <strong>Joel and Claudette</strong></p>
<p><strike>4.	Game over man...Game over!</strike> <strong><em>Aliens</em>: solved by darkpoole</strong> It's not subtle but it is exciting and Sigourney Weaver is a superb hero.</p>
<p><strike>5.	Well, I ought to. I spent the entire afternoon bumsening like mad with this ghastly old producer who promised to get me a contract.</strike> <strong><em>Cabaret</em>: solved by maurinsky.</strong> A rare film that I  liked when I was a teen and like it even more now. </p>
<p><strike>6.	I got a strange feelin' somebody's bein' hustled.</strike> <strong><em>Calamity Jane</em>: solved by Andy</strong> Great songs, three marvellous performances and I'll ignore lines like "That's female thinking"!</p>
<p>7.	I'm a master of deceit: a capitalist tool by day, and by night an agent of the proletarian masses - the Mata Hari of the Economic Miracle. <strong>This is the German one - and this could be a summary of the film's plot.</strong></p>
<p><strike>8.	You had a bullet from World War I in your leg, James! How did it get there?</strike> <strong><em>Twelve Monkeys</em>: solved by darkpoole and maurinsky.</strong> Bruce Willis is under-rated. </p>
<p><strike>9.	When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings.</strike> <strong><em>Heathers</em>: solved by Andy</strong></p>
<p>10.	Snakes are my life, in a way. <strong>same writer and director as 3</strong></p>
<p><strike>11.	Confidentially, I think you're a bit of a stinker, too.</strike> <strong><em>The Lady Vanishes</em>: solved by Andy.</strong> My favourite British Hitchcock.</p>
<p><strike>12.	But now, we have come almost to the end. One last step. And then when I take power, they will be pulled down and ground into dirt for what they did to you. And what they did in so contemptuously underestimating me.</strike> <strong><em>The Manchurian Candidate</em>: solved by Ellen.</strong> Angela Lansbury is just brilliant in this.</p>
<p><strike>13.	You live in a dream. You're a sleepwalker, blind. How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world is a foul sty? Do you know, if you rip off the fronts of houses, you'd find swine?</strike> <strong><em>Shadow of a Doubt</em>: solved by Ellen.</strong> An atypical Hitch with subtle acting, lots of menace and a superbly realised heroine.</p>
<p><strike>14.	My theory is that everyone is a potential murderer.</strike> <strong><em>Strangers on a Train</em>: solved by Andy</strong></p>
<p>15.	You are Columbus and I am America. Discover me, Ramon, just discover me! <strong><em>Romy and Michele's High School Reunion</em>: solved by Andy</strong></p>
