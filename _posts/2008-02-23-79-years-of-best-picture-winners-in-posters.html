<p><a href="http://www.movieposteraddict.com/2008/02/21/79-years-of-best-picture-winners-in-posters/" target="_blank">This is an interesting list</a> (from <a href="http://www.movieposteraddict.com/" target="_blank">Movie Poster Addict</a>) in many ways but not least because the Best Picture winners for approximately 75 out of 79 of those years are clearly <strong><em>not</em></strong> the best picture of that year and many are quite, ahem, ordinary films (<em>The Great Ziegfeld</em>, <em>The Greatest Show on Earth</em>, <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em>, <em>The Sting</em>, <em>Rocky</em>, <em>Braveheart</em>, etc) which perhaps shouldn't even have been nominated.</p>
<p>The art of the movie poster seems to have moved from paintings to photographs which in the case of the "who is she?" poster of <em>Rebecca</em> seems to be a good thing.</p>
<p>My favourite posters are <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>, <em>All About Eve</em>, <em>West Side Story</em> and <em>Amadeus</em>.</p>
