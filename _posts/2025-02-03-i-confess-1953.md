Montgomery Clift was attractive and very intense (and very hairy - a bonus). Anne Baxter had an annoying whispery mode of acting. I like that the killer was actually called killer, I mean Keller. Otherwise it's a bit of a downer after the funny Stage Fright and the funny in a different way Strangers in a Train. I get that Michael can't tell on Keller but at the very least he could have said in court that he was taking confession from someone.

I can't say I've seen many films shot in Quebec so there's that.
