  content: I thought the whole "is it a gun" thing was stupid - it so obviously wasn't
    a gun - there was just no way that Mad Men could go that way - the whole point
    of advertising is about deception and to suggest that DickDon would have to resort
    to murder rather than using his wits (or his money) didn't make sense. Trying
    to put suspense where there wasn't any was ridiculous. Apart from that I thought
    DickDon's meeting with Adam was beautifully written and acted.

<p><strong>Mad Men - <em>"5G"</em></strong></p>
<p>I was worried that <em>Mad Men</em> had descended into melodrama when, and I am sure it was deliberate, Don was rummaging in his briefcase in Adam&rsquo;s apartment and I thought he might produce a gun.</p>
<p>The man who played Adam was fantastic. I can&rsquo;t look his name up without finding out if he is in more than one episode of <em>Mad Men</em>. He was the perfect mixture of emotions: sad and vulnerable and happy and scared and anxious and desperate.</p>
<p>Peggy did tell Joan too much and she seemed to panic too much over Don's absence: it is entirely his job to explain himself. Joan was great in this episode with her twinkling eyes when talking to Peggy and leading the meeting.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that I don't much care about Don's relationship with Midge and I hope she's not too important in the future.</p>
<p>I did love the hilarious cut from sophisticated Don and Midge in her bohemian apartment to Pete in bed with Trudy with him wearing pajamas and a vest and eating biscuits and drinking milk. However, Pete is completely slimy and while I'm not sure if I like Trudy she certainly seems at this moment to be too good for him.</p>
<p>Paul is also horrible and to think he was almost nice.</p>
