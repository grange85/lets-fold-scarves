<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/saboteur.jpg' alt='Saboteur' /></div><strong><em>Saboteur</em></strong> Hitchcock doing Hitchcock is better than most other imitators but still this is a minor work and too much of a US copy of <em>The 39 Steps</em>. Priscilla Lane is adorable while Robert Cummings is serviceable and unexciting. The episode with the circus freaks and the finale at the Statue of Liberty were highlights.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/aguirre.jpg'  alt='Aguirre, Wrath of God' /></div><strong><em>Aguirre, Wrath of God</em></strong> Our DVD offered this in 5.1 German so naturally we watched it in 5.1 German only to belatedly discover (i.e. when it was finished) it was filmed <em>in English</em>. I feel particularly daft because I had seen it before <em>in English</em>. Anyway, it is in any language a remarkable film with an extraordinary atmosphere and an intense central performance from Klaus Kinski. It is both realistic and surreal. Real mud, real monkeys.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/innocents.jpg' alt='The Innocents' /></div><strong><em>The Innocents</em></strong> This is one of the two best ghost stories I have ever seen (the other being <em>The Others</em>) with three superb performances and the freakiest ending. If you have never seen then please seek it out and revel in Deborah Kerr&rsquo;s best work (and role) and the gleaming black and white photography. And because it's scary.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/strings.jpg' alt='Strings (Anders R&oslash;nnow Klarlund' /></div><strong><em>Strings</em></strong> I recorded this on a whim and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. It is simply amazing. The concept and execution is so remarkable that I forgive the rather dull plot. The puppetry was amazing and the fantasy world created made clever use of the actual limitations of really being a puppet on a string: gates and cages with high bars to keep you in, replacement limbs harvested from slaves and death from a severed head string. There were many notable scenes but the flaming strings falling from the sky was probably the most arresting moment.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/a-kiss-before-dying.jpg' alt='A Kiss Before Dying' /></div><strong><em>A Kiss Before Dying</em></strong> The holes in the plot of this do spoil it. The acting was variable: the father was wooden and Joanne Woodward defied her performance in this to become an Oscar winner while Robert Wagner was suitably creepy as the cold killer.  </p>
