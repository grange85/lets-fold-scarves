<p><strong><em>The Godless Girl</em></strong></p>

What a fabulous film. I can&rsquo;t think of any film before the fifties that focussed on teenagers (I&rsquo;ll conveniently ignore that none of the cast probably were teenagers &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t stop me from loving <em>BtVS</em>) so the beginning in a school was intriguing. And then the atheist theme kicked in.</p>
<p>The stance it takes on atheism vs Christianity isn&rsquo;t as clear cut as some of the comments lurking on the Internet suggest. A title card states: "Judy, daughter of atheism...Bob, son of Gospel...Intolerance <em>versus</em> Intolerance." To be honest, the message of conversion isn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> what appeals about this film. It is typical DeMille &ndash; show what you want as long as you pretend to be serving up a moral &ndash; <em>Sign of the Cross</em>, anyone? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5CXy_MYTJM">This</a> clip on YouTube gives you some idea of its moralizing and its humour.</p>
<p>It is funny, moving, over-dramatic and unsubtle with two awesome set pieces involving crowds of extras namely the fight between the Christians and the atheists and the astonishing fiery climax at the reformatory.</p>
<p>The cast were great although sometimes Eddie Quillan as Bozo looked like he had crept in from a farce. Lina Basquette with her gorgeous eyes can be summed up thus: multiple marriages, Hitler, rape and Great Danes. Tom Keene was fine as Bob and Marie Prevost was excellent as the Christian flirt (now there&rsquo;s an interesting character description) but she had a terrible end which I read years ago in <em>Hollywood Babylon</em> &ndash; she died alone a mere eight years later a lonely alcoholic whose body was gnawed at by her dog.</p>

I have never read <em>Five Children and It</em> but I had a sneaking suspicion that the film version was probably not a faithful adaptation and I was right. Why do they bother pretending? Or bother at all? Maybe because the Psammead is an excellent idea - and while this was pretty dire &ndash; it was Robin Williams', oops, Eddie Izzard&rsquo;s turn as It that made it sort of bearable &ndash; who can&rsquo;t love a rendition of the <em>Countdown</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQo6PwS358">countdown</a>? (That clip is more entertaining than the film.)</p>
<p><strong><em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em></strong></p>

I am such a bad, bad film buff because I am adding this to my collection of classics that I think are not <em>that</em> good really. The acting is horrendous &ndash; Una O&rsquo;Connor was an indescribably bad actress &ndash; I know she is supposed to be OTT but just. stop. Valerie Hobson and Colin Clive were awful - not that their lines helped them at all. Ernest Thesiger knew how to ham it up properly (as does Elsa Lanchester) and any scene with him in was worthwhile &ndash; particularly with the jars of little people and the scene in the crypt.</p>
