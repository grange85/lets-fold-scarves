  content: I wanted to like this movie too, but it was just too by-the-numbers for
    me. I enjoy romantic comedies, but I want them with a little substance, and this
    was so light and fluffy it seemed barely there. I liked a few lines, a couple
    of scenes, but not enough to make it worth the time spent viewing it. Too bad,
    because I saw a lot of potential there if the writer and director had just mined
    it a bit deeper.

  content: I thought Loving Annabelle was better in terms of good lesbian movies but
    I like Imagine Me &amp; You too. Sometimes we have to be thankful for cheesy lesbian
    movies with high production values and major distribution options. Sometimes it's
    better to have something than nothing at all...

  content: "<b>darkpoole</b> I think that is my problem with the film - it is
    just not deep enough and is, <b>Lea</b>, just the wrong sort of cheesiness
    for my tastes.\r\n\r\nI really liked <i>But I'm a Cheerleader</i> which had
    the right sort of cheese for me - a Stilton rather than a Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI
    shall look out for <i>Loving Annabelle</i>."

  content: It was a very pretty looking movie, but 35 minutes of screentime devoted
    to Piper Perabo moping is at least 33 minutes too many.

<p>Imagine Richard Curtis lite. Can you imagine Richard Curtis lite? How lite can that be? Well, <em>this</em> lite and trite. </p>
<p>I wanted to like this because a mainstream lesbian romantic (comedy) film is sort of rare. However, the ONLY redeeming feature was Lena Headey and her lower back tattoo (and I don't even like tattoos). Piper Perabo didn't quite live up to her fantastic name while Anthony Head reminded me of why I initially rejected <em>Buffy</em>.
