<p><a href="http://laughingwild.blogspot.com/2008/11/7-best-albums-meme.html">maurinsky</a> tagged me ages ago but at last I have cobbled together a list of seven albums.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Post your list of the seven best albums, the seven bloggers you will tag, a copy of these rules, and a link back to <a href="http://loc.rousefamily.com/leftofcentrist/?page_id=2144">this page</a>.<br />
2. Each person tagged will put a URL to their Blogger Album Project post along with a list of the seven best albums in the comment section <a href="http://loc.rousefamily.com/leftofcentrist/?page_id=2144">HERE</a> at Hill's Country. Enough already!<br />
3. Feel free to post the &ldquo;I Contributed to the Blogger Album Project&rdquo; Award Graphic on your sidebar (even though I couldn't find it), along with a link back to this page.<br />
4. Post a link back to the blogger who tagged you.</strong></p>
<p>Selecting seven albums was really hard, except for the Sugarcubes and Dusty Springfield, I could have chosen more than one album by the other artists.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Beatles &ndash; <em>Revolver</em> &ndash; not even &ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo; can ruin this album</li>
<li>Aimee Mann &ndash; <em>Bachelor No 2</em> &ndash; &ldquo;Save Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;Red Vines&rdquo;, Ghost World&rdquo;, &ldquo;How Am I Different?&rdquo; &ndash; exceptional songs and &ldquo;Save Me&rdquo; is the song that introduced me to Aimee&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>Nina Nastasia &ndash; <em>The Blackened Air</em> &ndash; Nina&rsquo;s albums are all exceptional but this seems to be the most perfect &ndash; she is a superb musician and performer &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know why she isn&rsquo;t feted as much as the usual suspects</li>
<li>Dusty Springfield &ndash; <em>In Memphis</em> - Dusty was a singles artist until this fabulous album &ndash; the standout for me is a glorious interpretation of &ldquo;Breakfast in Bed&rdquo; -</li>
<li>Kate Bush &ndash;<em> The Dreaming</em> - it was hard to choose between <em>The Kick Inside</em>, <em>The Dreaming</em>, <em>Hounds of Love</em> and <em>Aerial</em> but I settled on The Dreaming because it was the first Kate Bush album that I bought as opposed to listening to my sister&rsquo;s copies &ndash; I pored over the lyrics and dutifully played it loud as requested on the inner sleeve and loved its eccentricity</li>
<li>Tarnation &ndash; <em>Mirador</em> &ndash; this was hard too &ndash; it was either this or Paula Frazer&rsquo;s <em>Indoor Universe</em> but I chose this because of &ldquo;Little Black Egg&rdquo;, one of the most catchiest songs ever</li>
<li>The Sugarcubes &ndash; <em>Life&rsquo;s Too Good</em> &ndash; I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I listened to this because we have it on vinyl only but I choose it because it represents my realisation that I could listen to unusual and strange music and enjoy it - Bjork and Kate Bush are similar in that they both make weird and eccentric music that is popular (though they do polarise popular opinion)</li><br />
</ol><br />
(oh man, I had to miss out Carole King&rsquo;s <em>Tapestry</em> &ndash; sometimes million sellers are that for a positive reason &ndash; people enjoying classic songs by a classic songwriter with had warmth, depth and no sign of blandness)</p>
<p>I am unable to tag seven people so if you read this you are tagged.</p>
