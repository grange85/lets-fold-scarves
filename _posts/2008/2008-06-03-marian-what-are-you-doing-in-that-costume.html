<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887" title="Iron Man" src="https://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/06/downey-iron-man01141.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="291" /><strong><em></em></strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Iron Man</em></strong></p><br />
I went to see this with raised expectations with endorsements like the best comic book film ever and how refreshing Pepper Potts was as a heroine. What I had forgotten was that Jon Favreau had given us the verging on atrocious <em>Zathura</em> and that when people said Pepper was a decent heroine they meant as long as you only compare her to Mary Jane in the <em>Spidey</em> films. Robert Downey Jr is always interesting and he made the film as watchable as it was. However, I felt beaten over the head with the message that arms weaponry sales are a bad thing because that seems kind of obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882" title="Robin and Marian" src="https://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/06/robmar_233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><em><strong></strong></em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Robin and Marian</strong></em></p><br />
I used to maintain that this was my favourite Audrey Hepburn film and that isn&rsquo;t saying much &ndash; not much about the film anyway which is a mish-mash of broad comedic and broad dramatic elements as well as a touch of melancholy. Why were all the Merry Men Scottish? Just to match Sean&rsquo;s accent? After all, we know that halfway through <em>The Untouchables</em> he gave up on the Irish one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884" title="Walk the Line" src="https://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/06/walkthelinepic.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="200" /><strong><em></em></strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Walk the Line</em></strong></p><br />
This was on TV the other day so I watched it with Andy. I now have two <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2006/02/06/walk-the-line/">more problems with it</a> &ndash; his dad is too mean and June is too perfect. Reese is so damn lovable and June is too and that can&rsquo;t be entirely true, can it? <em>Walk the Line</em> is a standard biopic with outstanding music.</p>
