  content: If you're going to mean to Luna (and "Days..." is admittedly a pretty horrible
    cover) you could have chucked in <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/discography/album/29/"
    rel="nofollow">Penthouse</a> as a great one! Also you say "in our collection"
    and "Blind Faith" in uncomfortably close proximity!

  content: "[...] there&#8217;s one down side to the album it&#8217;s the sadly uninspiring
    sleeve but as Hazel pointed out a while back Kate has always had a tendency to
    wrap her masterpieces in &#8220;naff&#8221; [...]"

<p>This is a rather pointless post on album covers. </p>
<p>I had never listened to Electrelane before, despite several albums in the house, but when I saw <em>No Shouts No Calls</em>, I was struck by the great cover and gave them a go and now I like them (<em>just</em> as they go on hiatus...). </p>
<p>All these albums are in our collection and only include music I regularly listen to so<br />
there will be no reference to Blind Faith's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Faith_%28album%29">Blind Faith</a> (eww) or to Luna's <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/discography/album/35/">The Days of Our Nights</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">Covers that work for me:<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/electrelane-no-shouts-no-calls.jpg' alt='No shouts' /><br />
Electrelane - <em>No Shouts No Calls</em> - I like the simple colours and the fact it looks like a badge.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/espers-ii.jpg' alt='Espers II' /><br />
Espers - <em>II</em> - This cover in no way misleads as to the content of the album.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/aimee-mann-lost-in-space.jpg' alt='Lost in Space' /><br />
Aimee Mann - <em>Lost in Space</em> - Aimee's covers are usually unenticing and this I suppose for many would be no exception but the songs on the album are gloomy and you get what you pay for. Pylons are oddly beautiful,  I think.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/audrey-visible-forms.jpg' alt='Visible Forms' /><br />
Audrey - <em>Visible Forms</em> - This is pretty.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/nina-nastasia-on-leaving.jpg' alt='On Leaving' /><br />
Nina Nastasia - <em>On Leaving</em> - I like images of black and white trees a lot.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/mirah-advisory-committee.jpg' alt='Advisory Committee' /><br />
Mirah - <em>Advisory Committee</em> - To be honest, this cover makes me feel a little uncomfortable and yet it is intriguing.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/laura-viers-carbon-glacier.jpg' alt='Carbon Glacier' /><br />
Laura Veirs - <em>Carbon Glacier</em> - Another black and white image which I find arresting. If I was flicking through the racks in a record shop I would definitely stop at this.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/paula-frazer-now-its-time.jpg' alt='Noe It&rsquo;s Time' /><br />
Paula Frazer & Tarnation - <em>Now It's Time</em> - Aww, this is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Covers that don't work for me:<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/midlake-the-trials-of.jpg' alt='The Trials' /><br />
Midlake - <em>The Trials of Van Occupanther</em> - Wtf were they thinking? It must have been fun to dress up like that but how many casual sales did they lose?<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/kate-bush-aerial.jpg' alt='Aerial' /><br />
Kate Bush - <em>Aerial</em> - Kate Bush's sleeves are generally naff (except <em>The Dreaming</em>) but this is plain horrible. I bought <em>Aerial</em> regardless but I think this is dated and ugly. Kate, take at look at any Espers album cover, that's what your music is like.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bat-for-lashes-fur-and-gold.jpg' alt='Fur & Gold' /><br />
Bat for Lashes - <em>Fur & Gold</em> - Flipping heck, thank goodness Natasha Khan's music is in better taste than her costumes and artwork.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/kristin-hersh-hips-makers.jpg' alt='Hips & Makers' /><br />
Kristin Hersh - <em>Hips & Makers</em> - This is actually not that bad for a work of art. I can imagine it on my wall but in miniature on a CD case (or LP sleeve) its too messy and dirty looking.<br />
<img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/au-revoir-simone-the-bird-of-music.jpg' alt='The Bird of Music' /><br />
Au Revoir Simone - <em>The Bird of Music</em> - Snore.<br />
