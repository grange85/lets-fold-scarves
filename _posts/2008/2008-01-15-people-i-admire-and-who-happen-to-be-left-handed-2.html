  content: "I loved that Willow went for Tina Fey. Good taste, there. Brainy women
    are hot. \r\n\r\nI haven't watched 30 Rock yet, but I have seen her SNL work.
    She had great delivery as the \"Weekend Update\" anchor, and if she wrote her
    own material there, she's damn good."

  content: 30 Rock is probably the best show on American TV right now. The last episode
    that aired before they ran out (writer's strike) was surreal, bizarre and hilarious.
    I've watched it 3 times already.

  content: "Tina Fey is probably my favorite of my favoritest cute girls in cute glasses.
    She's smart, sexy, sassy, and hilarious.\r\n\r\nAnd what a nice touch having Willow
    dig Tina Fey. She is <i>so</i> Willow's type."

<p>I have scrapped my next candidate in this <strike>prodigious</strike> prestigious (you nit) series because I have just read "Anywhere But Here" (#10 of <em>Buffy</em> season 8*). </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/image006.jpg' title='Buffy 8.10 Willow and television&rsquo;s Tina Fey'><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/image006.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Buffy 8.10 Willow and television&rsquo;s Tina Fey' /></a></div><br />
So I am moving on to my next favourite left-handed person I <strike>love</strike> admire who is <a href="http://www.tina-fey.org/">Tina Fey</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/01/tina-fey.thumbnail.jpg' alt='Tina Fey' /></div><br />
 My appreciation of Tina Fey is based on <em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>30 Rock</em> and nothing else. I&rsquo;m British, I have never seen <em>Saturday Night Live</em> but since I know stuff and thence I do know that it&rsquo;s not actually my sort of thing and that would seem to make my like of <em>30 Rock</em> a touch baffling since it is about a programme <em>rather</em> like <em>SNL</em>. But actually, it&rsquo;s not really baffling at all, Jack and Kenneth and Liz and Tracy and Jenna are hilarious comic creations from the mind of Tina.  And her mind is brilliant because it thinks of lines like "Those shoes are definitely bi-curious" (more quotes below) and when she's interviewed in <em>Playboy</em> she says things like </p>
<blockquote><p>But for some of these other chicks, the closest they can get to a body like that is to remove everything that&rsquo;s there and add a little something on top. It&rsquo;s like the ladies you see in Playboy.</blockquote></p>
<p>And she wears glasses and she has a scar. Read <a href="http://dorothysurrenders.blogspot.com/2007/11/girls-do-make-passes-at-girls-who-wear.html">Dorothy Surrenders</a> and she'll explain better.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Jack: Sure...I gotcha. New York, third-wave feminist, college-educated, single and pretending to be happy about it, over-scheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says 'healthy body image' on the cover, and every two years you take up knitting for... a week.<br />
Pete: That is dead on!<br />
Liz: What, are you going to guess my weight now?<br />
Jack: You don't want me to do that.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: If I'm gonna be with someone, it has to be a guy.<br />
Gretchen: You sound pretty sure about that.<br />
Liz: What can I say, I love a bald spot and a hairy back.<br />
Gretchen: You're alone there.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Jack: Human contact is important Lemon. I can tell from your stress level that you have not been touched in any way in quite some time. Not caressed, not massaged, not even groped on the subway.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>
Liz: I hate going up to Donaghy's office even for something normal. I always feel like I'm entering the Death Star.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: No, Tracy took advantage of my 'white guilt,' which is supposed to be used only for good like over-tipping and supporting Barack Obama.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Gentleman: Excuse me, is this seat taken?<br />
Liz: [Sighs] Really dude? I got to move my coat? There are like 4 empty seats over there - can't you just be cool?<br />
[Gentleman leaves]<br />
Jenna: That guy wanted to buy you a drink!<br />
Liz: Really? But I already have a drink. Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks?</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Liz: [on the phone] Hi, my name is Liz Lemon and I received flowers from your shop tonight and I can't tell who they're from. [pause] No, no, I did read the card but it's not signed.... no, I'm not with so many men that it's impossible for me to guess...well, that is just...oh, well you know what, I found the card, actually, they're from your mom, so tell your gay mom I said thanks! [hangs up] </blockquote><br />
OK, she isn't credited with writing all these lines but she's in charge.</p>

And proof she is left-handed is in this compilation of all her scenes in <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE_SMJHCZ4">Mean Girls</a></em> (PS Lindsay Lohan is so lovely at the beginning of this film).
<p>
*However, if you are going to draw Tina Fey then maybe glasses would help and please <em>give her a waist</em>!</p>
