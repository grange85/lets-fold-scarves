<p>When I was in my teens and early twenties I used to keep a film diary. I&rsquo;d write down the date and place I saw the film (cinema or on which tv channel &ndash; not much choice back then) and a few sentences about my reaction to the film. Aren&rsquo;t people lucky I have the Internet now?<br />

<strong>I, Robot</strong></em></p>

I have no idea how this compares to the Asimov source but as a straightforward sf thriller it was reasonable although the CGI made most of the film look like a computer game (with added Audi advertising). Will Smith&rsquo;s attitude was irritating and clich&eacute;d while Bridget Moynahan was very attractive but not very dynamic. I was disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t recognise Alan Tudyk. </p>
<p><em><strong>Out of the Past</strong></em></p>

There often comes a time when I feel a bit of a fraud and not really a film buff when I watch critically regarded films like this and find them boring. Really though, femme fatales are such horrible stock characters. Men can&rsquo;t resist them and their evil allure and all the murder and mayhem is their fault for using their feminine wiles for such immoral purposes which is generally to get money. The men are drawn into their web and they can&rsquo;t help themselves. Anyway, Robert Mitchum was a remarkable looking man &ndash; both handsome and ugly at the same time &ndash; I suspect many people would put Nathan Fillion in the same category. </p>
