<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/07/01-12-kinky-boots-chiwetel-ejiofor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917" title="kinky boots - chiwetel ejiofor" src="https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/07/01-12-kinky-boots-chiwetel-ejiofor.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="199" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Kinky Boots</strong></em></p><br />
I was seduced by Chiwetel Ejiofor in this because for a long time he blinded me to how poor this film actually was. Why can&rsquo;t the girlfriend/boyfriend/partner/spouse <em>ever</em> be supportive? How are we supposed to believe that this couple never talked to each other about major financial decisions? I&rsquo;m not a writer but surely there is a better way of introducing tension than having our hero behave utterly abysmally towards the key to his and his factory&rsquo;s success?</p>
<p>It started on a high with Simon dancing on the promenade and with two beautiful shots: the train whisking Charlie away and Lola&rsquo;s red boots reflected in Charlie&rsquo;s face as he lies on the pavement. The fact that this shot wasn&rsquo;t repeated in the climax says it all.</p>
<p>The rest of the film was watchable but stupid. The final scenes in Milan were too contrived and the exuberance of the girls&rsquo; performance couldn&rsquo;t quite overcome that. I thought Joe Edgerton looked like Albert Finney and Ejiofor was just absolutely fabulous.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Hellboy</strong></em></p><br />
I have a disappointing almost next to nothing to say about this &ndash; the &ldquo;most underrated comic book adaptation&rdquo; or, indeed the &ldquo;best comic book adaptation&rdquo; &ndash; which feels peculiar. It failed to engage me perhaps because the actors (with the exception of Ron Perlman and David Hyde Pierce&rsquo;s voice) were bland and uninteresting and the story was, erm, the story was, sorry, I&rsquo;ve forgotten it already. Finally, cgi fights are most of the time uninteresting: I watch the trailer for <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> and as the two cgi creations leap towards each other, I start snoring.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Man Who Wasn't There</strong></em></p><br />
Around about three quarters through this film I realised that when it ended I was guaranteed to think sfw? I was right. Dull, dull, dull and having Scarlett Johansson offer Ed a blow job when she had shown no signs of sexual precociousness pissed me off no end. The Coen brothers peaked a long time ago.</p>
