  content: It's hard to see those scenes at the Bronze and the bedroom. I love the
    way Amber shines in season six. Really great recaps,and I'm looking forward to
    your commenting on OMWF

<p><strong>All the Way</strong> (Steven S. DeKnight)</p>
<p>I know that I view <em>BtVS</em> through my own lens so that this and &ldquo;Older and Far Away&rdquo; don&rsquo;t elicit the response from me that many others have towards them. First, I don&rsquo;t mind too much bratty teenagers doing bratty things (as long as it makes sense) and second, both episodes are significant in the stories of Tara and Willow. </p>
<blockquote><p>Tara: I'm not really much for the timber.</blockquote></p>
<p>I love the way that Amber looks almost apologetic for this joke which sadly enough does make me snigger unlike the wearisome &ldquo;I'm a breast girl myself&rdquo; from &ldquo;Life Serial&rdquo;.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/03/all_the_way_dance.jpg' alt='All the Way - The dance of capitalist superiority' /></div>Two fine moments from the Magic Box: The dance of capitalist superiority and Buffy&rsquo;s perfectly pitched shocked tone as she watches Giles clean his glasses and she says </p>
<blockquote><p>Is that why you're always cleaning your glasses? So you don't have to see what we're doing?</blockquote></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to see that Willow creating some &ldquo;extra biodegradable-y&rdquo; decorations is actually wrong but you can sense her arrogance and irritation at simply being challenged.</p>
<p>The dancing in the lounge is one of the most pitiful sights I have ever seen, except, maybe for Tara's sad face as she watches. She must be upset or she would be in fits of laughter.</p>

<p>The Dawn and Justin story is strangely non-compelling mainly because he and Zack behave like children and the kissing is, erm, amateur. And my interest is elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tara: Do you think Dawn might have come here?<br />
Willow: It's where I'd be if I were fifteen and on the lam.<br />
Tara: Really?<br />
Willow: Well, not me at fifteen, cause, hello, spaz.<br />
Tara: You?<br />
Willow: Yeah. Hard to believe such a hot mama-yama came from humble, geek-infested roots.<br />
Tara: Infested roots, trying to turn me on?<br />
Willow: I have to try now? </blockquote></p>
<p>Help me, what is that about? How would anything infested turn anyone on?</p>

<blockquote><p>Tara: Willow, you are using too much magic. What do you want me to do, just, just sit back and keep my mouth shut?<br />
Willow: Well, that'd be a good start.</blockquote></p>
<p>Poor "Grandpa".</p>

I like this exchange and maybe I'll try it out in real-life one day:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dawn: This the part where you tell me you're not angry...just disappointed?<br />
Giles: Pretty much...except for the bit about not being angry.</blockquote></p>
<p>The ending makes my heart sink and at the same time I find myself confused about how easy or hard spells are to cast depending on the mood of the scriptwriter.</p>

<p>Adam asides: Willow bitching at Tara in the Bronze prompted an <a href='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/03/oooo2.mp3' title='ooo'>ooo</a> from Adam while he astutely described Dawn and Justin&rsquo;s kissing as gorilla kissing (though he did mean <a href="http://images.fotosearch.com/bigcomps/BDX/BDX236/bxp40899.jpg">chimps</a>).</p>

How did this get here?</p>
