<blockquote>Girls grow up faster than boys do<br />
Girls grow up faster than boys</p>
<p>Girls grow up faster than boys do<br />
So, baby, I'm old enough for you<br />
Once you used to date my big sister<br />
Now, baby, she's too old for you</p>
<p>Won't you take a look at me now<br />
You'll be surprised at what you see now<br />
I'm everything a girl should be now<br />

<p>I don't really know where to start but any analysis of the words ought to leave a skeezy taste in your mouth.</p>
<p>However, what really gets me is that this is a Goffin and K..., thank goodness, not King but a Goffin and Keeler song. Gerry Goffin is a lyricist and so he is responsible for these words and those of "He Hit Me (and It Felt Like a Kiss)". I understand the background to "He Hit Me" but to translate the complexity of a troubled relationship into a three minute pop song is sometimes beyond the scope of talented wordsmiths like Goffin. I do rather wish he hadn't bothered trying.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Keeler co-wrote the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olzKKYvpUDA">theme</a> to the charming <em>Bewitched</em> starring the equally charming Elizabeth Montgomery.</p>
<p>PS On the other hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can recall the time<br />
When I wasn't ashamed<br />
To reach out to a friend<br />
And now I think I've got<br />
A lot more than<br />
A skipping rope to lend</blockquote></p>
