<p>After a dismal experience reading a literary novel (<em>The Blue Flower</em> by Penelope Fitzgerald) it was a real pleasure to turn to <em>Affinity</em> by Sarah Waters. (Actually, pleasure is not <em>quite</em> the right word...).</p>
<p>I came across the reference to <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/10/13/random-quote-3/">Tennyson's charming and by no means unusual view of women as being either pure good or pure evil</a>. I decided to look it up using my search engine of choice, Google, <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/08/17/ahem">and once again</a>, Google's "<span style="color: #cc0000;">Did you mean:</span>" turns up an insulting suggestion.</p>
<p>I put in the words <em>women heaven hell tennyson </em>and Google said<em> </em><span style="color: #cc0000;">Did you mean: </span><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enGB239GB239&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=when+heaven+hell+tennyson&amp;spell=1" target="_blank"><strong><em>when</em></strong> heaven hell tennyson</a>.</p>
<p>This goes nicely with the previous time that Google did this to me. I put in <em>"They are afraid women will laugh at them."</em>, it said <span style="color: #cc0000;">Did you mean: </span><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=ZuO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22They+are+afraid+when+will+laugh+at+them.%22&amp;spell=1" target="_blank">"They are afraid <strong><em>when</em></strong> will laugh at them."</a></p>
<p>No, I did not flipping mean <em>when</em>. When I type in <em>women</em>, I really, really, really expect to get results with the word <em>women</em> contained within. Seriously, why the fuck would I be expecting <strong><em>when</em></strong>? Just why?</p>
