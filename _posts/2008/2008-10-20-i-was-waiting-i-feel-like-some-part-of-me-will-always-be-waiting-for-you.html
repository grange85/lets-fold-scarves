  content: "I just assumed you had abandoned the Buffy discussion since you had covered
    all the good episodes.  I can't think of an episode after \"Tabula Rasa\" that
    I genuinely enjoy.  \"Seeing Red\" is a good episode but the last two minutes
    are pretty much the worst thing ever.  Lots of people seem to think that \"Normal
    Again\" is good, but I found it incredibly frustrating.  \"Grave\" is pretty good,
    I guess.  And the less said about Season 7 the better.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm curious
    if you've got anything to persuade me to change my belief that the series ends
    about 39 minutes into \"Seeing Red.\""

  content: "Charles, I do know how you feel but having viewed seasons 6 and 7 just
    the once I had to do them justice and watch them again.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons
    we stopped watching <i>Buffy</i> (the other was that I was studying for my
    final course in my distance learning degree) was that we were viewing as a family.
    I'm afraid that my eleven year old still hasn't recovered from Spike and Buffy
    doing \"hubba hubba\" and now thinks Spike is silly and an idiot and just didn't
    want to watch any more particularly when I told him there was more \"hubba\" in
    store.\r\n\r\nPlus, the Katrina story and Willow on the ceiling - he wasn't going
    to be allowed to watch that anyway.\r\n\r\nI think it's unlikely that I will be
    able to persuade you but we'll see!"

<p><i>Buffy</i> thoughts have been absent for over four months from this blog! No wonder my stats have been going down. No one cares about my film reviews and what I think of <i>Mad Men</i>.</p>
<p>But! "Wrecked" is just around the corner.</p>
