<p><strong>Bargaining I and II</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bargaining-buffy.jpg' alt='Bargaining - Buffy in her grave' /></div></p>
<p>As season openers go then this is one of the better ones &ndash; at least the first part is &ndash; the second part drags at times and the climatic scene between Buffy and Dawn is definitely too long. </p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s burial dress is quite unattractive and SMG&rsquo;s wig looked like the same one she wore in &ldquo;Beer Bad&rdquo; &ndash; both rather poor costuming errors. Maybe this is an omen for a season littered with errors of judgement. In fact these two episodes could be seen as a microcosm of S6 &ndash; a mix of the good, the intriguing and the bloody awful. </p>
<p>The good includes more Tara goodness in 80 minutes than the whole of S5 (minus a couple of episodes): Tara going &ldquo;Grr argh&rdquo; is just cuteness itself.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bargaining-tara.jpg' alt='Bargaining - Tara &ldquo;Grr argh&rdquo;' /></div>Plus, the teaser is glorious: "Oh, poor Watcher. Did your life pass before your eyes? Cuppa tea, cuppa tea, almost got shagged, cuppa tea?"
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bargaining-willow.jpg' alt='Bargaining - Willow' /></div>Intriguing includes Willow&rsquo;s solo determination to fix Buffy&rsquo;s death and the clear concerns of the others about what and (when they realise) how she went about it. The bloody awful includes some lame villains and Buffy&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/wp-content/2008/01/bargaining-dawn-and-spike.jpg' alt='Bargaining - Dawn and Spike on a bike' /></div>Spike and Dawn resume their relationship from &ldquo;Forever&rdquo;, the Buffybot continues to be perfectly played by Sarah Michelle Gellar ("That'll put marzipan in your pie plate, bingo!" and "'If we want her to be exactly she'll never be exactly I know the only really real Buffy is really Buffy and she's gone' who?") and Giles and Anya&rsquo;s relationship has plenty of sexual tension. </p>
<p>Finally, these two episodes are the source of Tara and Willow fan fiction&rsquo;s greatest clich&eacute;: pancakes.</p>
