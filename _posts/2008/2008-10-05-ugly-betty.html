<p>I watch <em>Ugly Betty</em> because of its fabulous acting and its zingy one-liners. If I think too hard about the plot lines and the occasional uneven characterization I stop liking it so I don't do that. And I certainly don't think about Betty and Henry and Gio - even when they are on-screen.</p>
<p>And just because here are two screencaps of Ashley Jensen. The first is from <em>Takin' Over the Asylum</em> (1994).</p>

<p>This is from the <em>Ugly Betty</em> episode "Burning Questions" (2008).</p>
