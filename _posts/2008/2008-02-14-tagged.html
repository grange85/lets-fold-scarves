<p>I got this from <a href="http://laughingwild.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html#1967093485984781129">maurinsky</a>:</p>
<p><em>Here's the deal:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Grab the nearest book (that is at least 123 pages long).<br />
2. Open to p. 123.<br />
3. Go down to the 5th sentence.<br />
4. Type in the following 3 sentences.<br />
5. Tag five people.</em></p>
<p>"Don&rsquo;t you get tired of wading in mud and filth? &ndash; No, I can&rsquo;t do that. Y&rsquo;know it. Especially this coming week, there&rsquo;s too much to do. I&rsquo;ve already been away too much." - <a href="http://www.faber.co.uk/book_detail.html?bid=7771"><em>Haweswater</em> by Sarah Hall</a></p>
<p>I tag any five people who have left a comment on this blog.</p>
