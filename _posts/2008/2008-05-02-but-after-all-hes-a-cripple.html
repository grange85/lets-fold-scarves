<p><em><strong>Leave Her to Heaven</strong></em></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img title="leave-her-to-heaven" src="https://www.moley75.co.uk/images/uploads/2008/05/leave-her-to-heaven.jpg" alt=""   /></div><br />
This is one of those films that end and you turn to your partner (or to yourself) and say &ldquo;is that it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what a waste of two hours&rdquo;. Luscious cinematography and fabulous locations couldn&rsquo;t make up for a plot that was so low-key that for the first hour almost literally nothing happened. The cinematography was so wonderful that when there was an obvious backdrop it felt almost like an insult. </p>
<p>Obviously the argument is that the film subtly builds up to the various evils that the possessive Ellen does but it needed to be totally over-wrought like <em>Duel in the Sun</em> and not so restrained. There were glimpses of the required madness in the awesome I-must-rewind-that-bit when Ellen (Gene Tierney) is scattering her father&rsquo;s ashes with a peculiar jerky sideways action followed by a long shot of her galloping and flinging the urn away. I admit the scene when she watches Danny drown was creepy and maybe if I never seen Bette Davis do the same in <em>The Little Foxes</em> it would have been more effective. </p>
<p>Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde don&rsquo;t click for me as performers. I have probably seen him in something else but I don&rsquo;t recall while she was insufficiently interesting for me in <em>Laura</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dick, Ruth and Mrs Berent behave so passively for most of the film that if any of them had <em>done</em> something instead of hiding or running away then it might have been more plausible. I concede that plausibility is not likely in a drama like this.</p>
<p>Gene Tierney&rsquo;s life was more interesting than her acting: the documentary <em><a href="http://www.doctormacro1.info/Film%20Clips/A/A%20Shattered%20Portrait%20(Gene%20Tierney).wmv">A Shattered Life</a></em> is a tasteful enough biography.</p>
<p>PS: I was chatting to Andy at lunchtime about our disappointment with this film and we were so animated about it that we realised we had appreciated it rather than enjoyed it.</p>
<p>PPS: Looking for images on the Internet has sucked me into reading several analyses of the film and I think I have been harsh and a re-view is in order. Just look at Gene Tierney's hands in the following screencap - she is a touch tense.</p>

<em><strong>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</strong></em></p>

<p>Charles Laughton was an amazing actor and his Quasimodo is a splendid creation completely on the right side of grotesque caricature. Cedric Hardwicke was chilling as Frollo (even if I did spend the film erroneously thinking he was Henry Daniell). Edmond O&rsquo;Brien was a sweetheart as Gringoire. Maureen O&rsquo;Hara was a mix of the spirited and the inadequate. </p>
<p>The story is a mess and I think it makes more sense if you have read the book (in which it resembles <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in its lack of comprehensiveness). As it is at the climax Quasimodo is enterprisingly killing people who are trying to rescue Esmeralda who is in danger but not from him. </p>
<p>The silent seconds when Quasimodo swings in to sweep Esmeralda away is rightly one of cinema&rsquo;s classic moments. The sets were enormous (and apparently and unsurprisingly very expensive) and the crowd scenes were so busy and exciting and real in a way that a bit of CGI just can&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>CGI reminds me of the <em><strong>The Matrix Reloaded</strong></em> of which I could only stomach an hour or so because it was simply terrible. The Wachowski Brothers should be congratulated for their multi-racial casting but not for their under use of Carrie-Anne Moss and for the worse fight scene <em>ever</em> when Neo fights multiple Smiths and it looks just like a computer game and what is the point of that?</p>

<p><em><strong>The Cat's Meow</strong></em></p>

The casting of this was tremendous with Eddie Izzard a surprising good Chaplin and with Kirsten Dunst and Edward Herrmann excellent choices as Marion Davies and WR Hearst. The black and white costuming worked very well in colour and I&rsquo;m glad they didn&rsquo;t make it in black and white because the bit at the beginning that was in B&amp;W looked bland rather than ravishingly silver. Poor Thomas H. Ince, his reputation ruined by the conspiracy theory disease, and played by the dull Cary Elwes in this.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sweet Smell of Success</strong></em></p>

<p>The problem with films like this that they are totally unpleasant to watch. I sat through the first hour utterly tense and so while I can appreciate that Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster were quite frankly brilliant (and neither Oscar nominated) and that the direction and photography were intense and atmospheric but I can't love it or want to ever see it again. The men were all creeps (except Steve) while the women were literally "things" to use and abuse and possess.</p>
