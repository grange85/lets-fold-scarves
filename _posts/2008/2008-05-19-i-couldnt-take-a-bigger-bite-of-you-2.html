I&rsquo;m not a big concert goer partly because the experience of being at a gig is generally poor for a woman of average height, partly because not everyone is there to listen with the same devotion as I am and partly because they often don&rsquo;t offer me anything more than I get from the music at home.</p>
<p>However, I was happy enough to go to Brighton for Andy&rsquo;s birthday for a Fatcat night at the Theatre Royal (particularly since they were circle seats). Silje Nes was excellent but she didn&rsquo;t have the same stage presence to go with her amazing music. Frightened Rabbit were a huge contrast and not quite my thing. However, when The Twilight Sad came on with their angsty singer (angsty about what though? I didn&rsquo;t understand a word) who didn&rsquo;t need that microphone stand I wanted the Rabbits back. Apologies to all fans but&hellip;they ain&rsquo;t no Nina.</p>
<p>Nina Nastasia came on and I&rsquo;m pretty sure she gave the best live performance that I have ever seen. At first, with the acoustic guitar and no sign of an accompanist and no sign of foot operated technical wizardry as Silje Nes had demonstrated I was fearful of a performance I would fall asleep to. She asked for requests and I, unbelievably, shouted out (for &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo;) and she didn&rsquo;t hear me so I had to pluck up my courage and do it again. Then she started and got a bit unravelled on the guitar playing and swore and it just didn&rsquo;t seem promising. However, she then proceeded to sing and play guitar almost impeccably for the rest of a very long but magical night. She was only supposed to play for forty minutes but an hour and a half later (or more) she had to definitely come to a halt when the theatre staff put the house lights up permanently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rubbish at titles (except &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo; obviously) but she definitely sung that, &ldquo;This Is What It Is&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oh My Stars&rdquo;, &ldquo;Brad Haunts A Party&rdquo;, and &ldquo;You Her and Me&rdquo; and many, many others in a truly mesmerising, absorbing way.</p>
