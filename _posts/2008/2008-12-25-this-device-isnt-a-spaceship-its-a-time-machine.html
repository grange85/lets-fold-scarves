  content: Betty is the character I care most about as well. I will not spoil you,
    but in series 2, Betty will blow your mind - January Jones owns the second season,
    in my view.

<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Wheel"</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1366" title="Mad Men - The Wheel" src="/images/uploads/2008/12/mad-men-the-wheel.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The Wheel" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>This was an amazing end to a great series. There were so many outstanding scenes and I'm not going to talk about most of them.</p>
<p>The most controversial storyline is not Betty spilling her heart to a pre-teen but Peggy&rsquo;s pregnancy. I&rsquo;m pretty much on board with any storyline <a href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/07/mad-men-calvaca.html">Matthew Weiner</a> wants to tell and I&rsquo;m not fazed by the unlikeliness of Peggy&rsquo;s lack of awareness.</p>
<p>The general comments on the AMC message board were alienating (but that&rsquo;s typical of a laxly moderated board) and patronising and ignorant (because it isn't<em> possible </em>for someone's experience to differ from the norm). However, this sort of thing happens <em>now</em> (<a href="http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2008/12/23/Woman_gives_birth_to_unexpected_baby/UPI-96051230081741/">here&rsquo;s one</a> from <em>two days ago)</em> and considering Peggy was using birth control and was eating a lot I&rsquo;m not amazed at all.</p>
<p>However, I had ENTIRELY dismissed the <em>idea</em> that Peggy was pregnant and I was gleefully wrong&hellip; She has to give it up for adoption though. It is simply impossible for her to keep it and continue working.</p>
<p>Don is so good at his job that he sold himself the dream of a happy family life in a quite incredibly moving scene (and there were no photos of it on the AMC site which is plain weird). I&rsquo;m not keen on fake endings but this one had a thumping impact. Betty&rsquo;s reaction when she realised he was coming was beautiful and Don&rsquo;s reaction when he realised he was too late was so sad.</p>
<p>I am reading a collection of <a href="http://www.jackson.classicauthors.net/">Shirley Jackson</a> short stories (<em>The Lottery and Other Stories</em>) written in the 40s and 50s. They are an amazing collection of stories full of repression, anger, humour and women on the verge. I would be surprised if Weiner or his team haven&rsquo;t read them and, if they haven&rsquo;t, what did they read?</p>
<p>Betty is a tragic figure and she is the character that I care most about. She is incredibly lonely and while her behaviour with Glen is wildly inappropriate I can see why she does talk to him in such a way. There is literally no-one else. All the other adults in her life have let her down. The psychiatrist &ndash; the one she should be able to trust &ndash; is telling Don everything, she knows (everyone knows!) that Don is unfaithful and he treats her like a child anyway and her father has turned to another woman mere months after her mother has died. She is alone and trapped. I am looking forward to seeing her character develop.</p>
<p>There was a scene cut from the BBC version involving Pete and Trudy in bed. I found this out by reading the TWOP recaps and I can't find a reason why and I&rsquo;m cross because I bet Pete was in his pyjamas.</p>
<p>Ah, what a fabulous series. Most of the time I forget that I am watching a contemporary drama set in the past rather than an old drama. It&rsquo;s like watching Sarah Michelle Gellar play Faith in Buffy&rsquo;s body in <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/05/07/our-m-mothers-&hellip;ny-tiny-babiesour-m-mothers-and-and-tiny-tiny-babies/">&ldquo;Who Are You?&rdquo;</a> and she is so utterly convincing that I get mixed up and hear Eliza Dushku speaking the lines. I can think of few higher compliments by making that comparison &ndash; SMG is superlative in &ldquo;WAY?&rdquo; and I cringe when people use that episode to illustrate that ED has range when she was blown away by SMG&rsquo;s performance.</p>
