<p><em><strong>Madeleine</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1238" title="madeleine" src="/images/uploads/2008/11/madeleine.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="300" /></p>
<p>As you would expect this is an impeccably made film by a true great. However, the other British great, Alfred Hitchcock possibly might have made a more involving film.</p>
<p>Ann Todd was icy as Madeleine. Actually what I mean is that icy Ann Todd played Madeleine and that cold centre of the film made it all rather mechanical. I did like the unequivocal ending with her face giving it away.</p>
<p>I've just realised Ann Todd was in <em>The Paradine Case</em> so maybe Hitchcock might not have improved this.</p>
<p>There was one outstanding scene when Madeleine persuades Emile to dance. She twirls, he gradually gets into the rhythm (<em>stick</em> and all) and soon they are dancing as uninhibitedly as the villagers in the valley below, and this scene is incredibly sexy. Seriously, I don&rsquo;t think I have seen a dance scene that was quite so effective before.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fitzcarraldo</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1239 aligncenter" title="fitzcarraldo- the gramophone plays" src="/images/uploads/2008/11/fitzcarraldo.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="360" /></p></p>
<p>We made Adam watch this by telling him it was about a man who drags a boat over a hill. That is true, of course, but we hadn&rsquo;t bargained on approximately an hour of film before he even gets his boat. Once it got going and Claudia Cardinale&rsquo;s disturbing dubbed breathlessness was left behind this became compelling viewing.</p>
<p>Kinski made have been bonkers but I reckon Herzog isn&rsquo;t too normal either. Not that I&rsquo;m complaining when people make films on such unlikely subjects and take me to places and eras I&rsquo;m never going to experience and make fantastic and magical films.</p>
<p><em><strong>House of Games</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" title="Lindsay Crouse in House of Games" src="/images/uploads/2008/11/house-of-games.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="242" /></p>
<p>This is a stupid film and Professor Maggie Walsh, I mean, Professor Margaret Ford is stupid for the majority of it.</p>
<p>Lindsay Crouse&rsquo;s performance is wooden and unemotional but I have less of a problem with that now than I did when I saw this in the cinema on its first release. She is just a strange actress and she is, at least, better than Rebecca Pidgeon. I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of the practice of directors casting their wives in films: it often leads to strange and uncomfortable dynamics.</p>
<p>I like Margaret&rsquo;s revenge and I do dispute Mike&rsquo;s assertion that he never hurt anyone. I think humiliation comes extremely close to hurt.</p>
