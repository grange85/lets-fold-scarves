<p><strong></strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1167" title="Peggy, Fred and Joan in Babylon and with a basket of kisses" src="/images/uploads/2008/10/mad-men-06.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Babylon"</strong></p>
<p>So Don&rsquo;s secret is that he&rsquo;s from a trashy dysfunctional family. Or is it?</p>
<p>This was the bedroom conversation episode and I'm not really a&nbsp;fan of such conversations which is perhaps why Don and Rachel&rsquo;s conversation was the most interesting. She needs to tell her sister that Don is funny particularly when talking to beatniks.</p>
<p>Don is also a big meanie. His wife tells him that she thinks about him all the time and the next night he tells her he needs to read a book instead of spending a little of his sexual energy in making her happy.</p>
<p>The other ad men were totally reduced to thinking with their willies in this episode and the two-way mirror scenes with the lipstick testing were borderline tacky.</p>
<p>Joan needs to work that considerable brain of hers and do something for the good rather than wasting it on a man who she knows is going to dump her and on bossing a lot of &ldquo;chickens&rdquo;. Though the final shot of Joan and Roger waiting for cabs separately was poignant (but not for him, the racist arrogant pig).</p>
<p>Oh, a <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/season-1-episode-list/">basket of kisses</a>! I wondered where it came from. Peggy is interesting but I&rsquo;m not going to take to her until she gets a new hair style (and she does have mouse ears and they are so cute).</p>
