<p>Andy and I struggled to the end of the second season and we won't be back for more.</p>
<p>Dull and, bizarrely, considering its subject matter, <em>unimaginative</em> with awful plotting and glaring errors in logic.</p>
<p>The series has managed to kill my liking for Greg Grunberg and is also responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>it managed to make a decent actor (Ali Larter) struggle in an unforgiving role that stunk: Nikki/Jessica/Gina</li>
<li>it reintroduced Sylar who was hard enough work for me to care about in the first season</li>
<li>it killed off Candice in the most pathetic way considering her power</li>
<li>Irish scenes of excruciating quality</li>
<li>Caitlin and her faux Irish accent and her boring romance with Peter</li>
<li>West and his creepy stalking which, <em>I think</em>, we weren't supposed to find creepy</li>
<li>Claire's lack of progression as a character</li>
<li>it killed off DL (the fab Leonard Roberts)</li>
<li>it gave Peter too many powers but conveniently forgot what powers they were if the plot demanded that power not be used (e.g. to read Adam's mind, to walk through doors)</li>
<li>casting the iconic Nichelle Nichols and then not use her</li>
<li>it made Kristen Bell's character unbearable to start with</li>
<li>it did nothing with Ando when he and Hiro had such chemistry the season before</li>
<li>and I haven't even mentioned Hiro, Noah, Mohinder, Nathan and the twins</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>So what was I watching?</p>
<ul>
<li>Stephen Tobolowsky</li>
<li>Elle in the last episode</li>
<li>Monica played by Dana Davis</li>
<li>the awesomeness of Ashley Crow as Sandra Bennet</li>
<li>Adrian Pasdar's beard</li>
<li>Cristine Rose as the chilling Angela</li><br />
</ul></p>
