  content: "\"essence of slug! shes not going to sleep with you anyway.\" \r\n- the
    mummy hand tapping on the top of the crate\r\n- holding a tong.\r\no that was
    too much.\r\ni agree SMG had perfect comic timing. \r\n\r\nother big bads were
    evil and you loved them for being so good at being so bad. \r\nthese 3 nerds were
    funny but i found them to be quite eerie and chilling at times. *shudder!!*"

<p><strong>Life Serial</strong> (David Fury & Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>This a pretty funny episode but it&rsquo;s surely no coincidence that once again in an episode written by Jane Espenson, Buffy&rsquo;s friends prove to be not very good ones. Why doesn&rsquo;t Tara question more where Buffy&rsquo;s disappears to? Why does Xander seems care more about this job than his friend? On the other hand, in the light of the incomprehensible characterizations and motivations in <em>Angel</em> maybe I should be grateful for the sense that <em>BtVS</em> does make.

<p>The trio turn up again and they are funny although the hilarity that is references to porn does my head in but otherwise amusing (&lsquo;Stop touching my magic bone!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You're insane. You're short, and you're insane.&rdquo;).</p>
<p>My favourite sequence involves Buffy as shop assistant which works on that irritating bell rift and revisits Buffy&rsquo;s (SMG&rsquo;s) finest physical comedy moment from &ldquo;<a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2006/10/11/do-you-really-think-youre-ready-buffy/">Surprise</a>&rdquo;.

<p>&ldquo;You play for kittens?!&rdquo; &ldquo;So, who's gonna advance me a tiny tabby, get me started?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I love Buffy getting drunk and her off screen <a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-bleh.wav">bleaahs</a>.

<p>It&rsquo;s very nice of Giles to give Buffy money but the Watchers&rsquo; Council are a bit naughty not to actually pay Slayers.</p>
