<p>Simply a great episode with so much to like about it. Alyson Hannigan's performance as various Willows; "Old Reliable" and the banana announcement; Anya's peevishness at being human; Willow's friends mourning her ("She was truly the finest of all of us." "Way better than me." "Much, much better.") and their reaction to her resurrection; some nice Cordelia and Wesley action; and, well, "I think I'm kinda gay."</p>
<p>I have never understood why Willow jumps to her snuggling conclusion and the rescue plan is a bit rubbish really (though Buffy does say it is a bad idea).</p>
