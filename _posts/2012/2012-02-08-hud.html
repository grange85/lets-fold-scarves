<p><small>When I'm in the mood I write brief thoughts on films in notebooks which then get transferred to my bag where they get forgotten. Well, I dug them out and I'm going to transcribe and tidy up those thoughts because I'm sure it'll be worth it...maybe.</small></p>
<p><em>Hud</em> (1963)</p>
<p>The photography! The acting! The themes! The key scenes! All faultless. This was a big Oscar winner in its time (but, bizarrely, not for Paul Newman) but I still thought it was great. You could see the Oscar bait in the form of Mervyn Douglas but since he gave a deeply moving performance, I don't care. </p>
<p>However, it is Patricia Neal who is brilliant. She is tough, smart, vulnerable and sensible, and knows when to leave.</p>

<p>And Brandon De Wilde was so lovable.</p>
