<p>S3 is maintaining its disappointing run. I genuinely thought it was one of my favourite seasons but very little has been thrilling me. It simply hasn't been appointment TV which goes a long way to explaining the long gap between updates to this blog. Of course, there isn't anything exactly <em>bad</em> about the series, after all "The Wish" was only five episodes ago, but it <em>was</em> five episodes ago.</p>
<p>However, things have begun to happen - Faith has accidentally killed a man (not murdered) and a new major character to the Buffyverse has entered the scene.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that I'm a bit of a bore on this subject but it is a bit of a bore: I hate what they are doing to Cordelia - she is thoroughly unpleasant and this is not nuanced writing - it's ugly and lazy writing.</p>
