<p>I tend not to read my old reviews before writing a new one but I did in this case and, boy, did I not like "The Zeppo". However, while Xander's character demolition and Cordelia's ugly behaviour are still bothersome, the episode itself is actually quite funny. </p>
<p>I am also older and wiser now, and quite frankly, since I don't really like Xander anyway, if I am quite blas&eacute; about the way that Steven Moffat wrote River Song's story (reduced to looking for a good man) then I can live with "useless" Xander for an episode.</p>
