<p>Today, Andy and I ran around Elthorne Roughs and a bit of the canal under the influence of Laura, the NHS, and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k.aspx">Couch to 5k</a>. The actual running lasted about 8 minutes while the walking part was 22 minutes. It's hard to envisage the time when the ratio will be the other way around.</p>
