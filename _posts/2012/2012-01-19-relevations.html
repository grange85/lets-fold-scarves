    And here we find out that Buffy really did forget all about Ms. Calendar's murder just so she could have her boyfriend back.  "If I thought that he would hurt any one of you"&hellip;wow, the man Angel tortured and the girl he paralyzed mush have loved *that*, even without Xander pointing out the Jenny-sized hole in that argument.

    It's nice that Giles finally gets the balls to call Buffy on her nonsense.  It's less nice that she respects this from him, but can't be bothered to listen to her friends, at all.  When Oz catches her in a lie ("But you were kissing him"), does she admit it?  No, she takes a cheap shot at Xander instead.  I love how Xander nearly laughs in her face when she accuses him of being jealous&hellip;hon, Xander's got two girlfriends right now.  He's over you.  You're not special any more.

    Of course, the "two girlfriends" issue is there because they wanted the audience to say "Well, Willow and Xander are sneaky cheaters!  Buffy's right to lie to them, they can't be trusted!"  A lovely bit of convenience to push aside objections to Buffy still pining for the undead mass-murderer who tried to kill them all less than a year ago. Oh, vomit.

    Hey, maybe a few years from now we can make Willow an addict and Xander have cold feet about his wedding!  Then we can have Buffy have "hot" sex with another "hunky" vampire boy, even if that one doesn't have the excuse of the Amazing Detachable Soul.

    (I could have sworn this show used to celebrate friendship&hellip;I could have sworn&hellip;)

    Aside from the continuing sacrifice of Buffy's character on the Altar of Vampire "Romance" (and the longterm implications thereof), a crackling good episode.  How often do you get FIVE kick-ass fights in an ep?  Willow is unbearably cute, Faith is heartbreakingly vulnerable (especially if she really did think she and Buffy were almost "dating") and it's just hilarious to watch Tony Head try to take the clonking from Gwen Post,  over and over again, on the blooper real.

    Nice job by Gwen just brazening her way to near-victory, too.  One call to Watcher Central would have cooked her goose, but she had them too cowed to even imagine doing so.

    "Interesting lady.  Can we kill her?"  Why, yes, Buffy, you can!  See, dreams can come true.

<p>Even when the actor is English, English characters always sound fake in the Buffyverse; consequently anybody from or purporting to be from the Watchers' Council automatically puts my back up. I like that the writers try to get English colloquial language right and, while Post says she's knackered in the correct context, it doesn't seem like anything her character would say. </p>
<p>It is a peculiar feeling when Xander is right but I don't mind because he is still pompous and obnoxious at the same time as not being wrong. There is so much lying going on at the moment, a real Scooby Gang weakness. Poor Giles.</p>

<p>I love Buffy, Faith and their stunt double fights so much. They look awesome together. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/01/29/you-boinked-the-undead/">Rewind</a> [I wrote a lot about this episode and I clearly cared more back then about the shenanigans going on. Now, I think I just want the soppy, soapy stuff to stop so I can enjoy great episodes like "The Wish" and "Doppelgangland".]</p>
