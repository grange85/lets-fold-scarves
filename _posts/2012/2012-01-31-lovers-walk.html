    it's not only disturbing, it's bloody stupid.  If Oz's SuperNose can smell Willow across town, how come he didn't smell her all over Xander the past three episodes?  (As he will smell her on Tara in "New Moon Rising".)  Stupid contrivance, almost as stupid as the staircase collapsing under Cordelia's weight when it just held two people a few seconds before (and held *three* when Spike brought W/X there).

    The "Spike liked Joyce" bullshit of S5 takes a hit when you remember that he was going to kill her just to watch Angel squirm here.   Of course that makes Buffy and Angel letting him stroll off at the end of the episode, just because he gave a silly, inaccurate speech about Love.  (Buffy and Angel *are* just friends by "The Yoko Factor", less than two years in the future.  Nice try, Sparky.)

    Spike rapes the shopkeeper's corpse.  Definitely the type of guy I want as the show's romantic lead, don't you?

    Still, not a horrible episode.  Mostly just Xander moments, though. ("I won, right?  Kicked his ass?"  Awwwww&hellip;) And, hey, we're done with Spike for another 16 episodes, that's got to be a good thing.

<p>A cracking episode that brings to a head a storyline I really wasn't enjoying. Poor Cordelia (and poor Oz too but it seems less awful for him since I know what happens...), she did give up so much for Xander and it's not as if he is even worth it.</p>
<p>Spike (and James Marsters) are fantastic - his moments with Joyce are a series highlight - but throughout he is funny, scary and not a little perceptive.<br /><br /><a href="/images/uploads/2012/01/20120131-205322.jpg"><img src="/images/uploads/2012/01/20120131-205322.jpg" alt="20120131-205322.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a></p>
<p>Willow sets a pattern (why, it's a Willow Pattern) - she turns to magic to help herself out of a problem. I love the way she says "there, there" to Spike - it is almost sincere. The episode is full of nice little moments like this: Buffy checking her make up in one of Giles' gadgets; the Mayor musing on mixed metaphors; Spike getting set alight; Cordelia's fake death - no, scratch that one, it's a bit of a cliche...</p>
<p>I have to agree with Cordy, Oz being able to smell Willow is disturbing, though I am surprised it wasn't just fear he could smell.</p>
