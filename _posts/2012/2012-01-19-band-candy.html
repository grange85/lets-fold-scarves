    Jane Espenson arrives and you can still smell the stench.  Maybe if her first episode hadn't been about ignoring the Scoobies and spending time with dumbed-down versions of Joyce and Snyder (two annoying characters who had already proven in "School Hard" that they are *really* annoying together), Jane wouldn't have come to the conclusion that Xander is an idiot and Willow is some sort of burden and a bad friend to Buffy.  (You see this in like half of her episodes, even before S6.  It's damn annoying.)

    "Ripper" Giles is a capering prat, who acts nothing like the Ripper we saw in "Halloween" or "Dead Man's Party".  And if he has a 16-year-old's urges, why is he MILFing with Joycie, instead of chasing the actual nubile teens in town?

    The whole episode is an unfunny version of an adult's view of teenagers.  (Drag racing?  Really??)  As Willow says, "I don't act like that."  Funny, I thought this show celebrated teens.  (Not with Jane writing it, it doesn't.  But hey, if Joss ever turns Buffy into a bored 40-something housewife whose only joy is empty sex with her "bad boy" stalker, Jane will be ALL OVER THAT.)

    Jane Espenson, glorifier of Jonathan, creator and pusher of Andrew.  Oh, joy.

    (Really hot anklesex, though.)

<p>That was a bit of a break, wasn't it? Too much soppy Angel and Adam lost interest so we watched other things but I missed it so much that here I am again.</p>
<p>This episode was derailed by shirtless Tai Chi Angel, and by Willow and Xander playing footsie: both events disturbed me more than Buffy was by her elders' behaviour.</p>
<p>In general, this was moderately amusing but I feel it is thoroughly over-rated. So, ironically, after all this time not blogging <em>Buffy</em>, I don't have much to say. Sorry Jane.<br />
