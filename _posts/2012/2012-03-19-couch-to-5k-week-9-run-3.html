<p>That's it. Well done.</p>
<p>I have completed the NHS Couch to 5k challenge in 11 weeks. I can run for 30 minutes non-stop which I estimate to be just about 3 miles so I think that I only have a few more runs to go before I can run 5km in the 30 minutes. </p>
<p>This is what I saw at the halfway mark yesterday.</p>

<p>I am proud of myself.</p>
