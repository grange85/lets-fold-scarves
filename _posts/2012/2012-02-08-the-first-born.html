<p><small>When I'm in the mood I write brief thoughts on films in notebooks which then get transferred to my bag where they get forgotten. Well, I dug them out and I'm going to transcribe and tidy up those thoughts because I'm sure it'll be worth it...maybe.</small></p>

<p><em>The First Born</em> (1928)</p>
<p>Good things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Madeleine Carroll throwing and catching a ball of paper a couple of times</li>
<li>
the use of superimposed subtitles in the crowd scene</li></p>
<li>
the plunge down the lift shaft </li>
<li>somebody naked in a bath</li></p>
<li>the handheld camera</li>
<li>the editing</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>All wasted in a film that was boring with unlikeable characters and a plot that I did not care about at all.</p>
