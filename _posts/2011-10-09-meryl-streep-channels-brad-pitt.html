<p>There is a scene in <em>The Hours</em> where Meryl Streep's Clarissa anxiously discusses the perceived triviality of her life with her daughter and she waves her hands about in a way that is just like Brad Pitt's Jeffrey Goines in <em>Twelve Monkeys</em>. It is odd, distracting and really very funny.</p>
