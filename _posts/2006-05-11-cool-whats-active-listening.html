<p><strong>Nightmares</strong> (story by Joss Whedon, written by David Greenwalt)</p>
<p>This is an interesting episode because it is the first to explore the boundaries of the show. It was atmospheric and spooky and sort of like Restless but without the cheese and with a moral.</p>
<p>The nightmares are all very recognisable though to be honest for Xander&rsquo;s to work he would have needed to be naked because he looked distinctly all right in his undies. By far and away, the worst nightmare was Buffy&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s brutal treatment of her, which was shocking and cruel (but not the most shocking and cruel of things that Buffy and co are eventually put through by cruelty meister Joss Whedon). Though Buffy being buried alive and Willow's terror on stage were pretty horrible too.</p>
<p>Blimey, the Annoying One is called Colin &ndash; what kind of scary name is that?</p>
<p>Hmm, vampire Buffy: &ldquo;I'll tell you something, though. There are a lot scarier things than you. And I'm one of them.&rdquo;<br />

&ldquo;When Buffy was a vampire, you weren't still, like, attracted to<br />
her, were you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Willow, how can you? I mean, that's really bent! She was grotesque!&rdquo; &ldquo;Still dug her, huh?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm sick, I need help&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much in the way of inspired dialogue (partly because it is a visual episode) but "at least I know my name".</p>
