<p><strong>Prophecy Girl</strong> (<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/pvp/77da/zoom/">Joss Whedon</a>)</p>
<p>"Even I was bored. And I'm a science nerd" "Don't say that" "I'm not ashamed. It's the computer age. Nerds are in. They're still in, right?"</p>
<p>"Well, Willow's not looking to date you. Or if she is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest" (rather pathetically I love suggestive dialogue like this)</p>
<p>"I'm not him. I mean, I guess a guy's gotta be undead to make time with you" (harsh indeed, Xander does not take rejection well and then goes on to insult Willow who has the sense to tell him she wasn't going to on a date with him as second choice)</p>
<p>"Willow! I really like your outfit!" "No, you don't" "No, I really don't, but I need a favour" (Cordelia is so much fun this time around)</p>
<p>"I wish to God I were! But it's very plain! Tomorrow night Buffy will face the Master, and she will die"</p>
<p>Buffy quits:<br />
<img id="image86" src="/images/uploads/2006/05/i%20quit.thumbnail.jpg" alt="I quit" /><br />
 "I don't care! I don't care, Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't want to die" (Sarah Michelle Gellar is amazing as Buffy and it is far too easy to forget how good she is. Her &ldquo;I quit&rdquo; scene shows off her exceptional talent)</p>
<p>"And you had your whole life ahead of you" "Yeah" "Must be nice" (poor Buffy)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just had the "I don&rsquo;t want to die" scene and we don&rsquo;t really think Buffy can get much darker because, you know, Buffy isn&rsquo;t going to die and this is just a show for teenagers. Then we are confronted with a room of murdered students and it&rsquo;s horrible and it&rsquo;s black and it&rsquo;s very serious.</p>
<p>"The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer. She's so little" (Jenny says it for us)</p>
<p>"When he wakes up tell him, I don't know. Think of something cool, tell him I said it" (Buffy stuck for a funny remark: things are bad)</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this? The Master kills Buffy! Xander and Angel are too late. That&rsquo;s not right. What is going on? What is this show?</p>
<p>Cordelia drives in the school, now that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>"No, I feel strong. I feel different" (what&rsquo;s with that? She was different in season six but not in season two which is a pity because it would have been nice to explore that idea of being different after death particularly with Kendra in the picture)</p>
<p>"I may be dead, but I'm still pretty which is more than I can say for you" (oh no, what terrible dialogue (at this point in this episode anyway))</p>
<p>The rest of the episode is reasonably exciting but the good stuff has all happened. The best stuff is still to come in season two when it becomes more daring, shocking and even funnier.</p>
