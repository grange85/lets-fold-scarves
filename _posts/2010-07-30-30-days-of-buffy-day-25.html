    What is the difference between a saying and a quotation?

    Anyway, I love the "rogue demon" one although I have stuck with <em>Buffy</em> rather than the wider 'verse.

  content: "I think a 'saying' is a recurring phrase like \"want me to come with?\",
    which is something they often said throughout the series (but which I've never
    heard said by anyone in real life). \r\n\r\nI guess I would lump Faith's \"5x5\"
    in the 'saying' category. I have no idea what 5x5 means, but she said it a lot.\r\n\r\nA
    'quote', IMO,  is just a one-off, like Cordy's comment."

  content: 5x5 is a military term. A reference to personal, structural integrity.
    It basically means, "Everything is solid; Squared." It could also be easily argued
    that it's a sly reference to the Vasquez character in Aliens, who was one of the
    Marines in that film and used that phrase at least once. Joss is admittedly a
    fan of the Alien franchise, having the privilege of burying said franchise, according
    to him. :)

<p class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 25: Favourite Buffyverse Saying</strong></p><br />
<em>Buffy</em> is stuffed with sayings. It is a quote monster.</p>
<p>The first one I thought of is "note to self: religion freaky" which I certainly agree with as a sentiment.</p>
<p>Then there is "Oh, poor Watcher. Did your life pass before your eyes? Cup of tea, cup of tea, almost got shagged, cup of tea?" and from the same episode "That'll put marzipan in your pie plate, Bingo!" and ""You know, if we want her to be exactly, she'll never be exactly, the only really real Buffy is really Buffy, and she's gone" who?".</p>
<p>Talking of Buffybot, here's a puzzled Buffy: "The who-whatting-how-with-huh?"</p>
<p>More Buffy: "I think I speak for everyone here when I say, huh?"</p>
<p>A bit of Cordelia wisdom: "Tact is just not saying true stuff."</p>
<p>Naturally there is "I'm so evil, and skanky... and I think I'm kinda gay." and following from that: "can we just skip it? can you... can you just be kissing me now?"</p>
<p>Some Joan: "I think I know why Joan's the boss. I'm like a superhero or something."</p>
<p>This is why I love <em>Buffy</em>: all these riches and I still haven't decided.</p>
<p>Try "I didn&rsquo;t jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were." or "It's entirely pointy!" or "Oh my God. I&rsquo;m cured! I want the boys!" or "Anchovies, anchovies, you&rsquo;re so delicious. I love you more than all the other fishes."</p>
<p>Do I have to chose? OK, it's twenty to one and I promised myself an early night so on the 30th July at 00:41, my favourite Buffyverse saying is "The girl&rsquo;s not playing with a full deck, Giles. She has almost no deck. She has a three."</p>
