<p>This has a good opening silent sequence and, let's face it, a lot of early sound films are only any good in the silent sequences because plummy accents coupled with stilted awkward acting have not worn well. So a man arriving at a mystery house on a windy night and finding an apparently dead man sets up the film rather nicely but once Leon M. Lion turns up (the actual leading man - baffling) it becomes less entertaining and more confusing. Hitchcock went to town with the lighting and the camera angles, and why not? I don't believe he didn't think it a ropey script.<br />

But, what does redeem it and what I remembered about it after a gap of maybe three decades since I first saw it, were the models - which are wonderful. The mix of models and live action in the train and car sequence is just brilliant. And very exciting.<br />
