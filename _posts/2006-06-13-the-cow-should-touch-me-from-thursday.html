<p><strong>School Hard</strong> (story by Joss Whedon, written by <a href="http://www.cityofangel.com/council/greenwalt.html">David Greenwalt</a>)</p>
<p>I see...so this is the reason why I disliked Spike and Drusilla in the early days: bad, bad, bad accents. At least Spike&rsquo;s modulated away from this Cary Grant impersonation but Drusilla&rsquo;s was always barking. <a href="http://vatzhol.club.fr/img/buffy124.jpg">Juliet Landau</a> is inexplicably bad as Dru (what were she and Joss thinking?) though I admit with a bit of work I can just about put up with her in later episodes.</p>
<p>The action wasn&rsquo;t very well put together; I was never entirely sure where any one was in relation to the others.</p>
<p>Good things: Cordelia praying, Joyce with an axe and Colin getting dusted.</p>
