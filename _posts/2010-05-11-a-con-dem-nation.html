<div class='posterous_autopost'> I feel sad that Labour are no longer in government. I waited years for the Liberal Democrats to come to power and now that that they are, I feel nothing but dismay because of who they are in power with.
<p />Best case scenario: the Con-Lib coalition becomes hugely unpopular because of the cuts that any government has to make. Labour come to power at the next election but only after dumping their commitment to every illiberal law they have made and on a mandate to have a referendum on effective proportional representation.
<p /> And I will never vote for any of the three main parties ever again. I should add that I have only ever voted for one of them.
