  content: "Willow or Buffy? It's a tossup for me. I love what Willow makes of herself
    as the series progresses. Buffy's talents are bestowed upon her in that she is
    The Slayer, the Chosen One, but Willow is self-made through her own motivation
    and determination to be a useful member of the team.  Buffy is a reluctant leader,
    but she comes to accept the role and when push comes to shove, she's willing to
    die for the cause (and does).\r\n\r\nThey compliment each other. I don't think
    I want to separate the two by picking a fave."

<p><strong>Day 4: Favourite Female Character</strong></p>
<p>Straight to the point: I had started to write a load of whinging about Tara's treatment on the show and a lot of whining about how much I didn't like Willow (and her hair) in S7 but I realised I said it all before, possibly better and certainly not worse.</div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>So my favourite character is <strong>Willow</strong> and one of the reasons is her choice of partners (pre S7 anyway) but there are other reasons (look back over my musings and see) and she had an amazing arc - not all of it was well executed but in terms of her character development it was plausible.</p>
<p>And she had three lines that are total classics: "Bored now", "Lunchtime be damned" and "And I think I'm kinda gay".</p>
<p>Here are stills of Willow from episode 10 of each season:</p>
