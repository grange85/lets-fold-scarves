<p>I am aware this is aimed at modern young people but it was an interesting experience answering the questions. The original is <a href="http://wbarratt.indstate.edu/socialclass/social_class_on_campus.htm">here</a> and I have deleted some questions which were irrelevant.</p>
<p>If your father went to college before you started<br />
<em>My dad left school at 15</em><br />
If your mother went to college before you started<br />
<em>My mum left school at 17</em><br />
If you have any relative who is an attorney, physician, or professor<br />
<em>One of my uncles was a teacher</em><br />
If your family was the same or higher class than your high school teacher<br />
<em>No, but I was friends with the daughter of a high school teacher</em><br />
If you had a computer at home when you were growing up<br />
<em>Very unlikely in the 70s</em><br />
If you had more than 50 books at home when you were growing up<br />
<em>Yes, they were mostly mine but dad read a lot of library books (he still usually has six on the go)</em><br />
If were read children's books by a parent when you were growing up<br />
<em>Certainly not from any time that I can remember but maybe when I was a toddler</em><br />
If you ever had lessons of any kind as a child or a teen<br />
<em>None at all</em><br />
If the people in the media who dress and talk like you were portrayed positively<br />
<em>That&rsquo;s a tough one because no-one in the media resembles our family &ndash; a working class one with liberal attitudes</em><br />
If you had a credit card with your name on it before college<br />
<em>Absolutely not</em><br />
If you had or will have less than $5000 in student loans when you graduate<br />
<em>I went to college when fees weren't an issue and grants were given for living expenses</em><br />
If you had or will have no student loans when you graduate<br />
<em>I was in debt but I soon cleared it</em><br />
If you went to a private high school<br />
<em>No but I did sit entrance exams for one but I didn&rsquo;t do well enough to get a bursary</em><br />
(International question) If you have been to the US more than once as a child or teen<br />
<em>No &ndash; we never travelled abroad except for when my dad was stationed overseas</em><br />
If your family vacations involved staying at hotels rather than KOA or at relatives&rsquo; homes<br />
<em>Ha ha &ndash; not even the British equivalent of KOA &ndash; we always visited relatives</em><br />
If all of your clothing has been new<br />
<em>Not with two older sisters</em><br />
If your parents gave you a car that was not a hand-me-down from them<br />
<em>Ha ha again</em><br />
If there was original art in your house as a child or teen<br />
<em>There isn&rsquo;t any now</em><br />
If you had a phone in your room<br />
<em>Er no</em><br />
If your parent owned their own house or apartment when you were a child or teen<br />
<em>Yes (with a mortgage)</em><br />
If you had your own room as a child or teen<br />
<em>Only when my sisters left home</em><br />
If you had your own cell phone in high school<br />
<em>Not in the 70s</em><br />
If you had your own TV as a child or teen<br />
<em>No way &ndash; not even a b&w portable</em><br />
If you opened a mutual fund or IRA in high school or college<br />
<em>What are they?</em><br />
If you have ever flown anywhere on a commercial airline<br />
<em>Yes &ndash; but only to come home from Germany and we usually drove</em><br />
If your parents took you to museums and art galleries as a child or teen<br />
<em>No</em><br />
If you were unaware of how much heating bills were for your family<br />
<em>What an odd question &ndash; my parents didn&rsquo;t share financial information with their children &ndash; however, I was totally aware of the need to turn lights off, keep doors closed, radiators turned down, etc</em></p>
