<p><img id="image426" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/lovers.jpg" class="left" alt="lovers - The Gutter and the Garden cover" />Thanks to a comparison made on <a href="http://reallyrather.blogspot.com/2007/03/funny-who-gets-noticed-and-who-doesnt.html">reallyrather</a> between Tara Jane O'Neil and Carolyn Berk of <a href="http://www.loverstheband.com/press.htm">lovers</a>, I decided to check them out and they are really rather good. I may have already listened to <em><a href="http://www.loverstheband.com/mp3/ginger.mp3">Ginger</a></em> a dozen times and the CDs only arrived on Saturday (less than a week from <a href="http://www.orangetwin.com/lovers.html">Orange Twin</a> records). I am such a sucker for strings.<br clear="all"></p>
<p>I don't actually agree with the comparison because I don't really hear that much tjo in Berk's songs. For one thing, her singing voice is a lot stronger and clearer than O'Neil's and her lyrics are much easier to discern. However, I do agree with the general notion that certain artists get noticed at the expense of others. I am rather sick of reading about Cat Power as if she is the only female singer songwriter out there.</p>
