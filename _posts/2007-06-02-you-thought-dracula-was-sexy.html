<p><strong>Buffy vs Dracula</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>The first opener not written by Joss Whedon but it's no better or worse than any of the others. It's interesting that even on DVD (i.e. without several months break) a new season takes a while to warm up. Buffy decides to take her calling more seriously which does lead to one of the worst opening scenes in the entire series in the next episode <em>Real Me</em>.
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image549" src="/images/uploads/2007/06/bvd-buffy.jpg" alt="Buffy vs Dracula - Buffy's outfit" /></div><br />
And Buffy&rsquo;s trousers and top in the final scene are very distracting from the seriousness of her words and it&rsquo;s how pregnancy rumours start.</p>
<p>One of the highlights is the acting of Nicholas Brendon who is highly amusing as his master&rsquo;s butt monkey. He is also super in <em>Real Me</em> and <em>The Replacement</em> so I&rsquo;m actually happy to have so much Xanman at the moment.</p>
<p>Giles is also funny but I&rsquo;ve no doubt putting Xander and Giles in humiliating situations is emasculating them (but in fact are parodies of Renfield and Harker).</p>
<p>The fighting style and the music have changed. I&rsquo;m not sure if I like the former and the latter hasn&rsquo;t hurt my ears - yet.</p>
<p>Willow lights a fire using magic and Tara doesn&rsquo;t look concerned but by <em>Out of My Mind</em> she&rsquo;s looking impressed but perturbed at Willow's abilities.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it."</p>
<p>"You think you know...what you are...what's to come. You haven't even begun. Find it. The darkness. Find your true nature." "Wow! That was gross."<br/></p>
