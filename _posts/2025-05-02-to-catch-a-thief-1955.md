To Catch a Thief is sometimes colossally boring and is the worst for Hitchcock cringe. Fireworks for gawd's sake. Cary Grant breaks my rule for March-October relationships only because he was so attractive and I would (have). Grace Kelly looked amazing at two points - the first time we see her with her mother when she looks like a goddess and later with water slicked hair. And we all shuddered when she was driving didn't we

The best thing about the film were the performances of Jessie Royce Landis and John Williams. Both were great in support.

The main problem with this is that Frances should have been the imitation cat because otherwise it's not that interesting a reveal and it would have been fun.
