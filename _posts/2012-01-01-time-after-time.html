<p>I think New Year's resolutions are a bit pointless because they tend to be quickly forgotten but I will make just one and that might be to blog more often. I may even start watching <em>Buffy</em> again.</p>
<p>2011's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hootenanny_(UK_TV_series)">Hootenanny</a> might have been awful but at least it reminded me of where this blog got its title from. (Though I still prefer "<a href="http://vrya.net/bdb/clip.php?clip=6394">Overhelping</a>" or "<a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2004/04/dame_stephanie_.html">F International</a>".)</p>
<p>So, this is a clip from <em>Romy and Michele</em> and is the best "improvised dance" scene in a film ever - no exaggeration...</p>
