<p>While I was watching the surprisingly well written biopic of Mrs Mandela (Michael Samuels did a good job of condensing nearly thirty years of her life) with its standout performance by Sophie Okonedo, I noticed this man in the <a href="http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,110268,00.html">necklacing</a> crowd scene. He really took me out of the scene because he looks like a pirate and it's just odd.</p>
