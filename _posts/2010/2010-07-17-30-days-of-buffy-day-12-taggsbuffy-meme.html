<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 12: Least Favourite Episode</strong></div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">"<a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/01/21/you-just-might-have-to-live-with-some-consequences/">Dead Man's Party</a>" or "<a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/07/15/vampires-are-vampires-and-my-job-description-is-pretty-clear/">Into the Woods</a>" are the episodes that I always think are my least favourite. Certainly my reaction to them was not positive. Give me a poor monster of the week episode like "Bad Eggs" than either of these.</div></p>
