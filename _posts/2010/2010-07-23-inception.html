  content: I haven't seen the movie, but in thinking back, I know among  the 4 of
    us kids, we refer to ourselves in age order.  When talking to us, I think my parents
    would call us by the wrong name.  Not sure how they refer to us to others.

<div class='posterous_autopost'>This film was certainly certainly interesting. I enjoyed hearing some people in a very well attended Wednesday afternoon groaning at the final shot.

<p/> If you have seen the film and have siblings and/or are the parent of children please answer the following question(s).
<p /><a id="more"></a><a id="more-2880"></a>
<p />In what order did your parents refer to you and your siblings? Alternatively, in what order do you refer to your own children?
<p /> Is there anybody other than Cobb who doesn&#39;t do it in age order? In my family, it was always Alison, Karen, Hazel. It was never any other permutation. Why would Cobb refer to his children (Philippa and James) in the wrong order? I think the children were cast in disregard to their actual age and without the script being changed.
