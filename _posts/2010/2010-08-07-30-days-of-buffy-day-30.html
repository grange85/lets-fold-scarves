  content: "So many things made Buffy great. Cute girls kicking ass and saving the
    world (a lot) never gets old, but more than that, I think Whedon just created
    a community that any of us would be glad to be part of. A community full of friendship
    and heart and loyalty and adventure and fantasy and love and heart-breaking loss
    and perseverance and vampires with souls and great opening credits and a pretty
    decent spinoff. \r\n\r\nWhat's not to like?"

  content: "For me, it was the writing.    Brilliant dialogue - every episode!   The
    comedy, horror and action were true to human emotion and that is why many of us
    were able to form a bond to it.\r\n\r\nThanks to those great writers!"

  content: "It was a hoot! \r\n\r\nI hope Whedon has another 5,6, or 7 season gem
    in him, sooner rather than later. \"Serenity\" and \"Angel\" were excellent, but
    I was disappointed with \"Dollhouse\", which had its moments (particularly after
    cancellation was announced), but which lacked the good-natured appeal of BtVS,
    \"Angel\", or FF."

    \"Alias\", BtVS), is promising a <a href=\"http://nikkistafford.blogspot.com/2010/11/great-buffy-rewatch.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">year-long Buffy rewatch</a> beginning January 4th, 2011,
    on her blog, Nik at Nite. \r\n\r\nThis sounds like a lot of fun for those of us
    who love the Buffster.  I've never participated in an episode-by-episode examination
    of any show, so I'm anxious to experience the value-added benefits of a proper
    rewatch. \r\n\r\nJust thought you might like to check it out, since BtVS is a
    \"minor interest of yours\""

<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 30 - What you think made Buffy so great?</b>
<p />Well, it could be Joss Whedon who created it and wrote the majority of my favourite episodes.
<p />Or it could be because it was funny, serious, silly, sexy, annoying, clever, frivolous, exciting, thoughtful, thought provoking and other such things.
<p /> It could be because the cast was great most especially <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/08/05/30-days-of-buffy-day-30-what-you-think-made-buffy-so-great/" target="_blank">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>.
<p /> Or it could be because of Buffy, Joyce, Cordelia, Willow, Amy, Harmony, Jenny, Kendra, Drusilla, Faith, Anya, Maggie Walsh, Halfrek, Tara, Dawn, Glory, Kennedy, and many more. A host of varied and interesting women, that&#39;s what made <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> so great.
