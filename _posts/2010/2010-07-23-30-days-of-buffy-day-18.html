<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 18: Character Who Didn&rsquo;t Get Enough Screen Time</b>
<p />This question is tantalising. If only it was asking another but closely related question! I can&#39;t think of many characters who didn&#39;t get enough screen time but I can think of plenty who didn&#39;t get enough decent dialogue or plotlines. I can also think of one or two who got too much screen time...
<p /> However, these one episode only characters came to mind quite easily: Marcie and Sunday. Marcie Ross was played by Clea DuVall and for that reason alone I would have liked to have seen her again. Sunday was a fun villain who may well have become tiresome but I would have liked to have seen that happen rather tha her single appearance.
<p /> But the character I would have liked to have seen more of is the towering figure of Miss Kitty Fantastico:
