<p />I was happy to read today that Anne Reid has been made a MBE although I was rather taken aback that she wasn&#39;t at least that already. You&#39;d think being Ken Barlow&#39;s wife would have been enough but when you add in Wendolene and Jean in <i>dinnerladies</i> and a host of other excellent performances I really was rather surprised.
<p /> If I had been given an honour years ago I would have been thrilled (and also puzzled because I haven&#39;t actually ever done anything) but now I think I would refuse one. I blame <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/nov/27/poetry.monarchy">Benjamin Zephaniah</a> for opening my eyes.
<p /> I am very interested in who have refused one and always disappointed when it turns out they were just waiting for a better one...: however, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3338583.stm">according to a leaked document</a>, the painter LS Lowry turned down the most honours and I do note that Emma Thompson still hasn&#39;t got one (don&#39;t let let me down).
