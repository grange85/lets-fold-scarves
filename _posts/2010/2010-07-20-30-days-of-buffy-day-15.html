  content: "I thought the Mayor was a hoot. \r\n\r\nSpike endured a lot of pain to
    turn his life around.  I think he deserves a break on the villain business or
    at least a hyphenated title, like ex-villain."

<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 15: Favourite Male Villain</strong><br />
There's the Master, Collin, Ted, Angelus, The Mayor, Adam, Warren, Caleb and dozens more but there is only one villain who I loved from the moment he appeared on my screen. I loved him for most of four seasons when he was thoughtful, jealous, scheming, funny, chipped, sexy, and a bit useless at actually being an effective villain despite all the efforts. It all went sour as seasons 5, 6 and 7 progressed but then he wasn't so much of a villain so no matter.</p>
<p>So it's <strong>Spike</strong>: "And you're what? Shocked and disappointed? <em>I'm evil</em>!"</p>
