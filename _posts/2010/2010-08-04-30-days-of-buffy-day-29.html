  content: "You don't like \"The Prom\"? I LOVE \"The Prom.\" Truly, it's rather girly
    and frivolous, but I think SMG and Charisma Carpenter are great it. Plus, \"Cordelia.
    The spatula.\"\r\n\r\nI think \"Amends\" is horrible."

  content: I don't like "The Prom" but I do like "Homecoming" which is the episode
    with the spatula. Tsk tsk.

<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 29: Episode You Hate That Everyone Else Loves</b>
<p />I know that I am Ms over-sensitive at times but the use of the word <i>hate</i> when <i>dislike</i> is the word required bugs me. The overuse of <i>misogyny</i> when <i>sexism</i> would be a good enough word is also galling because it robs the <i>m</i> word of its true meaning and power.
<p /> Anyway, <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.org/buffy/byrank.htm">back to my list of <i>Buffy</i> episodes</a> and I&#39;ll look for a top twenty episode because I can&#39;t imagine not liking anything from the top ten. Stop. I&#39;m going to cheat myself and go for a top thirty episode because I have just spied "The Prom" at #25. (I&#39;m almost tempted to go for #33 because that&#39;s "Amends" and that&#39;s pretty close to matching "The Prom").
<p /> This is all a bit stream of consciousness and since I have just read my <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/02/02/let-me-guess-is-it-evil/">old comments</a> about <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/03/04/i-got-all-teared-up-when-they-played-we-are-family/">these episodes</a> I&#39;m going to call it a tie.
