  content: Here i sit on a cold winter's night in Melbourne after midnight just having
    watched another rerun of Buffy (end of S5) on Fox. As always, I turn off the TV
    and say "that show is just so well written" and contentedly head of to bed. Always
    a bit guilt or embarrassment as I think surely no-one else succumbs to watching
    Buffy renruns night after night.  Anyway tonight I thought I would see if anyone
    had uploaded a image of Buffy's gravestone. Of course they had.  And then suddenly
    I come across a site named 'Lets Fold Scarves'. I read a blog entry thinking it
    was posted years ago. YESTERDAY! What???   So essentially my posting is to say
    thankyou to letting me know there are other slightly disturbed obsessives out
    there. I might add a comment or two in the future. But I don't analyse the episodes
    all too much. I just like to watch all of them. And after each, head of to bed
    with a contended sigh. *Sigh*. Good-night.

    Thank so much for this comment. I'm not the only "slightly disturbed obsessive" around all these years after <em>Buffy</em> went off the air. Just have a look on LiveJournal or Tumblr for a start.

    It was truly a great show.

<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 16: Episode You Like That Everyone Else Hates</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.org/buffy/">This website </a>is awesome if you think lists and rankings are in any way fabulous which they are. I'm going to use <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.org/buffy/byrank">this particular list</a> to get a generally accepted bottom ten episodes and it certainly looks like a bottom ten:</p>
<p>(10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reptile Boy (David Greenwalt)<br />
(9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 136 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Assembly Required (Ty King)<br />
(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 137 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inca Mummy Girl &nbsp;(Matt Kiene &amp; Joe Reinkemeyer)<br />
(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 138 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go Fish (David Fury and Elin Hampton)<br />
(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 139 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beer Bad (Tracey Forbes)<br />
(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 140 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher's Pet&nbsp;(David Greenwalt)<br />
(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 141 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad Eggs (Marti Noxon)<br />
(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 142 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the Wild Things Are (Tracey Forbes)<br />
(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 143 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, Robot...You, Jane (Ashley Gable &amp; Thomas A. Swyden)<br />
(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 144 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doublemeat Palace (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p>The first thing to note is the sheer number of absolute stinkers there are in S2. The second thing to note is that David Greenwalt has two episodes there and he was the showrunner on <em>Angel</em> for three seasons. Just saying. The third thing to note is that two of the episodes have so much to like about them that I can't hate them (plus there is my soft spot for "I, Robot... You, Jane" just for Willow hitting Moloch with a fire extinguisher and shouting "Remember me, your girlfriend?")</p>
<p>So "Beer Bad" has a heavy handed anti-alcohol message but cave girl Buffy is hilarious plus the "Gutterface" scene and, of course, let's not forget the most important message, "Fire bad!"</p>
<p>But I have a strong liking for "<strong>Where The Wild Things Are</strong>": if you remove the seemingly endless sex (and ignore the issues of informed consent), it's a good episode because there is funny stuff like Xander and Anya arguing in an ice cream van, Spike and Anya getting chatty, Spike remembering he was evil and going off to watch <em>Danger Mouse</em>, Giles singing, Xander being brave and, best of all, from my point of view, some lovely Tara and Willow development.</p>

"Guaranteed safety and fun". (Amber's hands look huge in this scene on the stairs.)</p>
