<div class="posterous_autopost">Andy and I cycled to Kensal Green Cemetery today mostly via the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/4675665366/sizes/l/"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4675665366_a3a05d2ac0.jpg" border="0" alt=""   /></a></p>
<p>The cemetery is full of the famous and the non-famous (nice to see so many locals). We found many of them with the aid of a map. We also missed a great many (Wilkie Collins, William Whiteley, John Passmore Edwards, Thackeray, Trollope, Henry Mayhew, etc) but we did manage to see Blondin, Pinter, Dr James Barry, the Brunels, Babbage, etc.</p>

<p>My favourites were the memorials to Robert Owen and to other reformers (I was delighted to see how many of them were women):</p>
