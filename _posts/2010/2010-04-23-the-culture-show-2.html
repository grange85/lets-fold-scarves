<div class='posterous_autopost'>I realised early in the latest run of <i>The Culture Show</i> that after the first show which was presented by Verity Sharp, the show was exclusively presented by a man and the vast majority of the reporters were men (I can only think of Miranda Sawyer and Clemency Burton-Hill for the distaff side) and that each week I kept hoping against hope that the <i>The Culture Show</i> might surprise me but no.
<p /> The majority of the artists featured were also men: Siri Hustvedt and Jenny Holzer notable exclusions.
<p />I wonder if it&#39;s any coincidence that this series was generally pretty dull from my point of view.
<p /> What makes it more galling is that the editor and the executive producers of the show are women.
