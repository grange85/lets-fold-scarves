<p><i>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</i> is 25 years old. Margaret Atwood talked about her book on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00c2y2k">Woman&#39;s Hour on Wednesday 10th November</a> along with journalist Alex Clark. The book always seemed to me to be a warning for the near future and it seems as relevant now as it was then. I was surprised that Jenni Murray focused on Afghanistan rather than the USA though she did mention the Tea Party.<br></p>
