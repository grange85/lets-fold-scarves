<div class="posterous_autopost">On Saturday, I attended a showing of two silent films accompanied by live music at Kings Place. I had never heard of Kings Place before the <a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2010/04/_birds_eye_view" target="_blank">F Word blog</a> alerted me to the <a href="http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/kingsplace" target="_blank">Birds Eye View Sound and Silents</a> events there.<br />
<a href="http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kings Place</a> is a lovely venue (but I do think it is missing an apostrophe). Hall One where the films were shown is covered in an oak veneer which was wonderful. However, the stage seemed a bit high and, due to the fact that the films were projected over the heads of the musicians, my view from the third row was rather awkward. I would like to go back to have a coffee next to the canal basin on a nicer day.<br />

<p>I found <em>The Danger Girl</em> with Gloria Swanson a little incoherent. It was nevertheless quite amusing and the few stunts that it had were jaw-dropping: a car passed within inches of a horse (twice), a car stopped in front of a person just in time and a small bus burst into a restaurant full of diners. The female vocal trio <a href="http://www.juicevocalensemble.net/">Juice</a> did a fabulous job of adding to my enjoyment. They were a lot of fun.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Ich m&ouml;chte kein Mann sein</em> aka <em>I don't want to be a man</em> was a disappointingly superficial three-reeler by Ernst Lubitsch. I suppose if it hadn't played with gender roles quite so explicitly then I might have not have been quite so dissatisfied. The three leading performers were very funny and some of the situations were amusing (the governess smoking, Ossi being measured for a suit and, of course, the kissing) bit overall it fell a bit flat. The music by <a href="http://www.zoerahman.com/">Zoe Rahman</a> accompanied by her drummer was marvellous but by my cloth ears it didn't quite suit the film.</p>
<p>This clip is from another Ossi Oswalda/Ernst Lubitsch collaboration and it is a huge amount of fun with a great new score.</p>
