  content: "I share your frustrations with what seems to be the continuing trend of
    women taking their husband's names when they marry without any consideration.
    I don't care so much if women change their names just like I don't care if women
    wear make-up, tight skirts, and high heels. However, I would like for women to
    be aware of how patriarchy influences those decisions, which seems to be missing
    most of the time in both instances. \r\n\r\nI agree with you about the absurdity
    of number 6, but I do know some women who chose to change their name for the reason
    listed in number 7. I even know some men who chose to take their wife's last name
    for that reason. In those instances, they had very contentious relationships with
    their father -- some even had been abused. I can understand wanting to distance
    yourself from any reminders of especially an abusive parent. And I think many
    of them thought of their last name as <i>their father's name</i> rather than
    their own, so shedding that name symbolically ended their father's ownership of
    them in a way."

  content: "I think that was the essence of Melissa's post - that some people like
    myself are lucky enough to have circumstances that allow them to do whatever they
    want - I do believe that three/four years ago I wouldn't have known that was
    called <em>privilege</em>. So, yes, I am lucky that I have a great dad and
    I have no problems living with his surname the way that other people can't with
    theirs.\n\nI do think though that if you feel that bad, you should change it anyway
    and not wait until you get married but I suppose most people don't even think
    about that possibility until marriage.\n\nDid you know that Portia de Rossi is
    now Portia Degeneres? My first thought was aww, then slight irritation and then
    the realisation that Portia de Rossi isn't even her real name anyway. It's Amanda
    Rogers.\n\n\n\n<blockquote>What's in a name? That which we call a rose \nBy any
    other name would smell as sweet.</blockquote>"

  content: Susan had the same reaction you did to the news that Portia was changing
    her name, but we were both pacified by the fact that she chose the name Portia
    de Rossi.

<p><a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2010/11/any_feminist_wh">Is it feminist to</a>&hellip;<a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2010/11/pro-choice.html">change your name when you get married?</a></p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t but then I don&rsquo;t think it is feminist to get married at all.</p>
<p>I was horrified when I rather belatedly realised that our marriage certificate asks about our fathers but doesn&rsquo;t give a toss about our mothers. I got married primarily to make an explicit statement about my relationship to Andy and I got married in a registry office because I am an atheist but also because I thought a registry office ceremony would be devoid of sexism. I obviously didn&rsquo;t think hard enough.</p>
<p>The list over at Shakesville is quite thought provoking but also has some poor excuses:</p>
<blockquote><p>6. Because her maiden name was her father's name and keeping it did not feel like any more a rejection of the patriarchy than taking her husband's name did, and she liked her husband's name better.</blockquote><br />
My surname is my father's surname but more importantly to me it is also my surname: the moment my mum and dad decided to call me Hazel Alma Ruby Simpson it became my name and my name is extremely important to me even though I had no choice in the matter. I had a choice to stop the patriarchal tradition of taking a man's name when I got married*. [Also, I would find it almost impossible to think of a new name for me.] I also think that final comment is a bit of a <em>non sequitur</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>7. Because her maiden name was her father's name, and she likes her husband a lot more than her father.</blockquote></p>
<p>This one makes me go "eh?". I love my dad a lot, I love my husband a lot but that that has bugger all to do with me keeping the name I have had for 45 years (or 33 years when we got married) and it assumes the two choices are of equal weight: there is no choice in having your father's name but taking your husband's name is a choice.</p>
<p>I am not criticising anybody who changes their name because I'm not them and even the reason because "I wanted to" is good enough but a little part of me cringes, sighs and deflates when a woman changes her name.</p>
<p>Finally, one commentator on another site made the observation that as a history student it saddened her that some women's history is lost because their name changes have rendered them invisible.</p>
<p>*Not that I really <em>made</em> that choice because if I had ever thought of getting married before I did, I had never had any intention of changing my name.</p>
