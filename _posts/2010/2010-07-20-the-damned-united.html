<div class="posterous_autopost">Tremendous performances from Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall (though he didn't look anything like Peter Taylor) and Jim Broadbent (who may not have looked liked Longson (I don't know) but looked like a football chairman from the 70s) and there was too much exposition (the characters know the details and we don't need to know the details) but it was funny and never boring.</div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost"></div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">The scene at the end with Taylor taking Clough back was like the end of a rom com. It was sweet but I couldn't help thinking it just emphasised why there are few decent roles for women: the men have them.</div></p>
