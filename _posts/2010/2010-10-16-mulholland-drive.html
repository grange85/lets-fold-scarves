  content: "I watched it on HBO, and unsettled is exactly how I felt, that beginning
    after all the fun dancing was ominous and freaked me out.\r\n\r\nAnd I completely
    agree with your assessment of Naomi Watts. She really gave an astonishingly great
    performance in this movie."

<div class='posterous_autopost'>When I first saw Mulholland Dr it was in the cinema and the combination of tracking shots and the ominous soundtrack and that shock behind the diner, made it a tremendously unsettling experience. I was often literally too scared to watch it in case I was freaked out again.
<p /> Years later, watching it on DVD in the comfort of my own home and knowing there was nothing as scary as that shock, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Halfway through I was saying to myself "how come I didn&#39;t understand this before?" and then the blue box appeared...
<p /> There are plenty of interpretations on the Internet and I&#39;m sure they are all valid, however, all I have to add is that Naomi Watts is extraordinary as Betty/Diane. The scene when she auditions in a packed office is jaw dropping.
