I have managed to get past Enrique Iglesias and I'm currently listening to the next song by Usher (which sounds EXACTLY the same) but the accumulative effect of autotune is literally making my stomach ache.</p>
<p>I don't actually know who the woman in this picture is but I think she may be Katy Perry so in this case she could be kissing a girl (<a href="http://lesbianswholooklikejustinbieber.tumblr.com/">no offence, Justin</a> - also a great number of teenage heartthrobs have looked like young women (except four of the Bay City Rollers obviously)).</p>
