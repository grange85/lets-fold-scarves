  content: I, Claudius was a favorite of mine, I bought a CD of PBS theme songs specifically
    for the theme music, which was perfection.

  content: I tried rewatching Blake's 7 a few years ago because I remembered it as
    so fascinating from when I was in junior high.  Including the Avon thing, yes,
    I do admit.  I did not feel like it stood the test of time, but you may feel otherwise.

  content: I really found it difficult to come up with a comparable list. We watched
    a lot of telly but the things that stick in my head were either kids shows (Dr
    Who, Tomorrow People, Children of the Stones, Grange Hill - I particularly remember
    the awesome Carrie's War) or US cop shows - particularly Columbo. More recent
    stuff sticks in my head Our Friends in the North, State of Play.

  content: "Wait, \"Out Of Gas\" was written by Tim Minear. I thought you didn't like
    his work? And yes, I concur. The episode is fantastic. My favorite of the series.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    If you liked Dead Like Me so much (I love season 1. \"Nighthawks\" is may favorite
    ep, but after Bryan Fuller left, season 2 was mostly just okay for me), you should
    definitely check out his follow-up, Wonderfalls if you haven't already. Word of
    warning though: Tim Minear is all over that show, too."

    Heh, I was shocked and amazed when I realised that Tim Minear had written "Out of Gas" (until I paid attention I <em>naturally</em> assumed it was written by Joss Whedon) but he (Tim) is allowed that one perfect episode. Btw, I did enjoy that podcast you did with Tim on "True Believer", I enjoyed hearing from behind the scenes. It was illuminating.

    As for <em>Wonderfalls</em>, I liked it a lot but, since they are often linked together, not as much as <em>Dead Like Me</em>. I wish Caroline Dhavernas <a href="http://www.televisionaryblog.com/2007/07/shut-your-pie-hole-televisionary-sits.html" rel="nofollow">had been cast in <em>Pushing Daisies</em></a> and then I might have liked that.

    I liked <em>Dead Like Me</em> as much after Fuller left. I much preferred Daisy to Betty but I do wish they hadn't chickened out of making George's dad gay.

<p>In the light of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jan/12/guardian-50-television-dramas">The Guardian's top 50 television dramas of all time</a>, I thought of the dramas that I remembered fondly and also remembered being, well, top. So, here's a list which is not in any order except for the first mentioned.</p>
<p><em>Buffy, the Vampire Slayer</em> life-changing and worthy of a blog post or two</p>
<p><em>I, Claudius</em> the best British drama, completely studio bound yet full of vigour and gripping stories; the acting is astonishing and it was clever, sexy, violent and funny</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="445" height="364" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/E9cKGYhuQKQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="445" height="364" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/E9cKGYhuQKQ&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"> </embed></object></p>
<p><em>Edge of Darkness</em> yes, it is dated in many ways but the story is what matters (as well as Bob Peck's mesmerising performance) [oh my, while looking for clips of this I have found it has been remade (by the same director) with Mel Gibson as Craven]</p>
<p><em>Mad Men</em> best show on TV, it may be more style than substance to some but not for me and for the moment I am in love with it<em> </em></p>
<p><em>Fortunes of War</em> oh, Ken and Em, how did I love you? a lot and this very expensive drama was worth every penny</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/74avc_-vApE&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/74avc_-vApE&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>The Jewel in the Crown</em> it's the characters that make this particularly Daphne Manners, Sarah Layton and Ronald Merrick although the backdrop of the Raj is always fascinating</p>
<p><em>Dead Like Me</em><em> </em>I have only seen this once but it was an instant classic to me; I adore the characters</p>
<p><em>Survivors</em> I rewatched this recently and it was slow and frankly boring in parts but Carolyn Seymour as Abby simply owned the series and for that, thank you!</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-VeO_JhIXiY&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-VeO_JhIXiY&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>Tenko</em> this was compulsive viewing when I was a teen, character driven <em>and</em> all those characters were women; I loved Louise Jamieson, Veronica Roberts and Stephanie Beacham</p>
<p><em>Firefly</em> one series of highs and lows: "Out of Gas" is among the best episodes of anything of all time</p>
<p><em>Battlestar Galactica</em> I do wish the Cylons really had had a plan but putting nitpicking the entire series aside, parts of this were flipping brilliant</p>
<p><em>Blake's Seven</em> I last saw this when I was a teen but it has stayed with me and I do think I should revisit it just to see how it stands up dramatically and to see if I can work out the reason why Avon was attractive (I don't want to think about the special effects)</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NoHkaFDTiD8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NoHkaFDTiD8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object>  (wow, that looks, um, well...the theme music's good)</p>
<p><em>Tutti Frutti</em> Emma Thompson again and I remember loving this very British drama</p>
<p><em>The Life and Loves of a She-Devil</em> this was outrageous and although I enjoyed the majority of it, I always hated the ending which probably means I missed the point</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jVIFqWOgWKU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jVIFqWOgWKU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>Taking Over the Asylum</em> Ken Stott is magnificent in this and the setting is certainly unique</p>
<p><em>When the Boat Comes In</em> we really used to make brilliant lengthy historical series like this, <em>Poldark</em>, <em>The Onedin Line</em> and <em>The House of Eliot</em> and make them seem effortless</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="445" height="364" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cOh9LQxdmGI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="445" height="364" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cOh9LQxdmGI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>Carniv&agrave;le</em> okay, I have only seen eight episodes but I think this has potential to be very high on my list (if it was in any order)</p>
<p><em>A Very Peculiar Practice</em> I thought this was fabulous when i was young, I was less enamoured with it when it was repeated relatively recently but Barbara Flynn was the business as Dr Rose Marie</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/feRLKkMnKw0&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/feRLKkMnKw0&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>Testament of Youth</em> seen once but I remember it made me cry a lot</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="445" height="364" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9y1sDdIA6oA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="445" height="364" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9y1sDdIA6oA&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><em>Therese Raquin</em> this was filthy, I remembered that very well but on rewatching I appreciated even more the performances of Brian Cox, Kate Nelligan and a very youthful looking Kenneth Cranham</p>
<p><em>A Very British Coup</em> this felt like a documentary and the ending is so tragic</p>
<p><object width="445" height="364"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2oOW_TNJqnQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2oOW_TNJqnQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="445" height="364"></embed></object></p>
<p>[I think I had a rather odd crush on Alan MacNaughtan who was also in <em>To Serve Them All My Days</em>]</p>
<p><em>The Crow Road</em> great stuff, thoroughly Scottish with a standout perfomance by Bill Paterson</p>
<p><em>Fanny and Alexander</em>, <em>Berlin Alexanderplatz</em> I am shamefully putting these together but both are examples of great foreign TV series directed by people better known as film directors, both were gripping and both were more mature than anything on British TV at the time</p>
<p><em>A Kind of Loving</em> my forgotten gem in this list</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="445" height="364" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ywUtl-wHM8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="445" height="364" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5ywUtl-wHM8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>A list of other things I watched when I was younger: <em>To Serve Them All My Days</em>, <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em>, <em>Angels</em>, <em>Juliet Bravo</em>, <em>The Gentle Touch</em>, <em>All Passion Spent</em>, <em>Driving Ambition</em>, <em>The Beiderbecke Affair</em>, <em>Jonathan Creek</em>, <em>Chandler &amp; Co,</em> <em>Bergerac</em>, <em>Shoestring</em>, <em>Between the Lines</em> - bloody hell, telly was good in the old days!*  What I think is interesting is that I didn't watch many American imports (notably <em>The Rockford Files</em> and <em>Cagney & Lacey</em>) when I was young because they were all rather rubbishy. How things have changed.</p>
<p>*Of course, it wasn't. This is a list from approximately forty years of TV and I don't think I have even listed one series a year. And I'm sure <em>Spooks</em> or <em>Life On Mars</em>/<em>Ashes to Ashes</em> are to other people as good as, say, <em>The Gentle Touch</em>...</p>
