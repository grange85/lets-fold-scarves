  content: "Giles was the pack leader, a dedicated man who understood the importance
    of his work, who sought no recognition for his efforts, and provided stable leadership
    for an unlikely group of young warriors. Unfortunately, he came a little unhinged
    in S7, and became just a little too whiny and unhelpful to Buffy at a time when
    she could have used his support. \r\n\r\nSpike was certainly more colourful, but
    Giles was more important to the show."

<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 6: Favourite Male Character
<p /></b>This is easy. <b>Giles</b> is my favourite character. I&#39;m not looking forward to day 7 because I might upset someone.
