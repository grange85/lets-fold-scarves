<div class="posterous_autopost">Thanks to the consistently good at recommending music blog, <a href="http://curiouslytasty.blogspot.com/">Curiously Tasty Music</a>, I have discovered the marvellously named <a href="http://www.noreallyrock.com/"><em>No, Really</em></a> (might she be a <a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/%7Etvshrine/buffy/b-whatyourname.wav"><em>Buffy</em></a> fan?) who makes music that immediately appeals to me. Strong female voice and a folkish tinge. Not that I'm entirely clear what folk is these days. Kathryn Williams is called folk and she says she isn't really.</div></p>
