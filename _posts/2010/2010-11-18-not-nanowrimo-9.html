<p><b><i>The Mosquito Coast</i></b><br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img title="b00vhlw3_640_360.jpg" alt="b00vhlw3_640_360.jpg" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/images/episode/b00vhlw3_640_360.jpg" height="236" width="420"><br></p>
<p></div><br>With the exception of <i>Picnic at Hanging Rock</i>, I don&#39;t think you can say that Peter Weir is interested in telling stories about women. In this, the redoubtable Helen Mirren plays a woman who doesn&#39;t even have a first name but is known as Mother and is a mainly passive character. However, in the film&#39;s defence, the character is no different from the one&nbsp; in the book on which the film is based but what a waste of Mirren. Additionally, everyone but Allie Fox is a cipher, even the narrator played by River Phoenix is barely there.<br></p>
<p> <br>The set piece explosion is fantastic and I think the film is generally compelling but because it is strongly reminiscent of <i>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</i> and <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>, it just seems pale by comparison. Certainly, I enjoyed it a lot more than I did before I was familiar with Herzog&#39;s films.<br></p>
