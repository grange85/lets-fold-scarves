  content: "I agree although there's a gulf of difference between those two. \r\n\r\nThe
    first was just an idle quip born out of frustration. Paul Chambers is not a comedian
    and the \"joke\" was not supposed to last much beyond the 20 secs it took to type
    it in - we all make crap jokes from time to time and that was all it was... there
    was no \"menace\" and really there was no death and destruction implied (and it's
    baffling and hugely worrying that anyone could think that there was).\r\n\r\nThe
    second was ignorant and hateful and bigoted and said by someone (a politician)
    whose views and opinions have some credence.\r\n\r\nI think it's unfair to bundle
    them together."

  content: This was a throwaway post and I agree with you really. They aren't really
    connected except by coming to prominence at the same time.  My point is that I
    wish people wouldn't use such ugly language which trying to say something.

<p>I believe that people have the right to make jokes. I just wish they were funny and didn't wish for death and destruction.</p>
