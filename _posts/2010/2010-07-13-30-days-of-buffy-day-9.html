  content: "I had high hopes for Xander and Miss French (\"Teacher's Pet\"), but I
    guess that was doomed from the start. \r\n\r\nI think my fave was Willow and Oz.
    As much as I loved Tara, I could never really buy into Willow converting to lesbianism
    midstream. Anytime I see a gay or lesbian story unfold on a fictional TV show,
    it smacks of sensitivity training and I bristle at being socially engineered by
    TV writers, even the great ones. And besides that, Oz was just such a cool customer.
    Hell, he even changed his hair colour, how cool is that?\r\n\r\nGiles and Jenny
    deserved much better.  Gee, way to go Angelus."

<p><strong>Day 9: Favourite Romance</strong></p>
<p>Ah romance: the wooing and the early exciting days of love.</p>
<p>There are two clear candidates for this category. Both shockingly involve Willow. It's interesting to see the difference between them. Oz and Willow's romance was open, sweet and amusing but Tara and Willow's was entirely metaphorical and, bizarrely, all the more pleasurable for it.</p>
<p>Willow and Oz were adorable. The way he noticed her ("No, not her. The Eskimo!), the way he first asked her out ("I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night".), the way he refused to let her use him and her realisation that actually he was pretty cool ("See, in my fantasy when I'm kissing you, you're kissing me. It's okay. I can wait.), her sheer excitement at having a boyfriend ("My boyfriend's in the band!), etc.</p>
<p>Tara and Willow are a different story, however, how some people could have side-swiped by the events of "New Moon Rising" astounds me. From the moment we meet dyed blonde Tara, metaphors explode into action: a strong and powerful connection moves heavy objects; a red rose of romance flies around a room losing its petals; a crystal exchanges hands (that's not really a metaphor but I do like the way Tara greets Willow and lets her in her room*); there's a trip to the Nether Realm with panting, sweating and, er, the flaming o; Tara offers Willow a ride but knee-touching is disgusting; Tara and Willow talk about getting a cat; and then it all comes out and it's not so metaphorical and not a romance any more.</p>
