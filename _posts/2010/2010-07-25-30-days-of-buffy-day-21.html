<div class='posterous_autopost'><b>Day 21: Best Willow-centric Episode</b>
<p />This I will find simultaneously both harder and easier than Day 20&#39;s Spike question. Easier because it&#39;s straightforward for me to conjure up Willow episodes I particularly like and harder because I have to chose one.
<p /> It&#39;s not that hard actually but I&#39;ll get to that.
<p />It could be "I, Robot...You, Jane" because she was funny when she was angry and except for the laughable computery stuff it wasn&#39;t that bad an episode.
<p /> It could be one of the episodes where her partner is as important to the story as she is such as &#39;Wild at Heart", "New Moon Rising", and "Tough Love". It could be a pissed off Willow episode like "Something Blue" except for me it&#39;s Buffy and Spike that make that episode outstanding.
<p /> As you know Crack Willow doesn&#39;t do anything for me so I can&#39;t even consider any episodes from S6 but I do like "Same Time, Same Place" from S7.
<p />It&#39;s obvious what&#39;s missing and it&#39;s one of my favourite episodes of the entire show and it&#39;s the one where <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/02/17/im-a-blood-sucking-fiend-look-at-my-outfit/">Alyson Hannigan is awesome: "Doppelgangland".</a>
