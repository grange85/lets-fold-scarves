  content: It's very rare that I see a film and think, "That was a story I hadn't
    seen before." <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i> was one of those. I think my favorite
    bit of dialogue from the film is "You were staring at my tits." "No, I'm sure
    I wasn't. And if I was, it was as a representative of the United States Government."

  content: I agree. It's a wonderful idea and Emma Thompson's plummy tones just work
    beautifully.

<div class="posterous_autopost">At its worst, <span style="font-style: italic;">Stranger Than Fiction</span> is the common and boring story of the unattractive guy being paired with the younger hot girl, and with those wonderful eyes, Maggie Gyllenhaal is hot but thankfully <span style="font-style: italic;">Stranger Than Fiction</span> is so much more than that. It's very clever, very funny, exceptionally well-acted, has <a href="http://media2.mk12.com/v5_qt_html/2007/stf_opening_sequence.html">great motion graphics</a>, is plausible, has Magritte references and has a flours joke. It also has cakes and biscuits. It's the perfect film...Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are the standouts along with Queen Latifah in her mannish clothes and Tony Hale as the space cadet.</p>
<p>Will Ferrell is great too. My favourite bit is when he hears the narrator say "Little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death." because I like how we both say "what?" in unison.</p>
<p>I like the contrast that in a novel, a happy ending is simply an "okay" compromise while that in a film of this nature, a happy ending is vital. Simply put, in a great book Harold has to die but in a great film he certainly cannot.<br />
=====<br />
After the magnificent <span style="font-style: italic;">Volver</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Broken Embraces</span> was a bit of a letdown. It was funny and full of great scenes but it was overlong and I&rsquo;m also not convinced of Penelope Cruz&rsquo;s acting ability. I do think Blanca Portillo is fabulous though. Her ageing was done exceptionally well but I&rsquo;m afraid the younging of the man who played Ray X made him look like David Walliam&rsquo;s Lou character from <span style="font-style: italic;">Little Britain</span>.</p>
