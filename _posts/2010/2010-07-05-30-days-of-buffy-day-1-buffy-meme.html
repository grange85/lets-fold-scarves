  content: My favorite season is definitely season 3. It has Doppelgangland, which
    is one of the funniest and most well-written television episodes of all time.
    w00t.

  content: "Yes and \"The Wish\" as well which is another awesome episode. But one
    of the reasons why I didn't choose S3 is because there are too many episodes where
    I can't remember just by looking at the titles quite what happened in them but
    that isn't as true of S2 or S4.\r\n\r\nThanks for commenting!"

  content: "I have to go with S5. I loved the whole idea that the Monks created Dawnie
    and placed her in Buffy's life for safe keeping.  I think Dawn-for-Joyce was a
    good trade to make after 4+ seasons. Death was not Buffy's gift, Dawn was her
    gift, and a timely one, considering the state of Joyce's health.\r\n\r\nThe Scoobie
    solidarity shines through in S5.  Sometimes there can be a lot of friction, but
    whether you're undead or alive, former demon or a ball of energy given human form,
    there's room for you in Buffy's camp if your heart is in the right place. \r\n\r\nThe
    Dawn/Spike relationship in S5 was very sweet (and fleeting as subsequent seasons
    would prove). Spike defending Dawn from Glory's evil intentions and their beautiful
    scenes in Spike's crypt as he tries to convince her that she's not evil. And Dawn
    nursing Spike's injured hands in the motor home when the others had difficulty
    showing their gratitude for his efforts.\r\n\r\nGiles was never the same after
    his library job ended. The Magic Box was a rebirth for him. I liked it, especially
    after he spent S4 watching TV at home with Spike. Unfortunately, it didn't last
    long, as he eased into semi-retirement in the final 2 seasons. \r\n\r\nS5 was
    the season to spot the \"Alias\" actors (Marshall Flinkman, Sloane Clone, and
    The Rose).\r\n\r\nAnd, of course. S5 brought  us \"The Gift\" and that wonderful
    scene with Buffy and Dawn high atop Glory's tower, with both of the Summers girls
    offering to take the leap to save their friends and the world. Dawn's heartbreaking
    plea to Buffy (\"you have to let me go, the bloods starts it and until the blood
    stops flowing, it'll never stop. you know you have to let me...it has to have
    the blood.\") has to be Michelle Trachtenberg's finest moment on BtVS.  And then
    Big Sis takes over, kisses Dawnie goodbye, and does what Slayers do, saves the
    world one more time.  A stunning conclusion to what I think was Buffy's best season."

<p><strong>Day 1: Favourite Season</strong></p>
<p>Oh, tough one. I love, love, love a lot of episodes S4 but overall the season isn't completely satisfactory so it's between S2 and S3. And I can't remember what I chose before so it must be close!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It's <strong>S2</strong> because "Some Assembly Required", "Reptile Boy", "Bad Eggs" and "Go Fish" are still better than "Dead Man's Party" and "Beauty and the Beasts".</p>
<p>ETA: <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2007/03/06/make-it-meme-if-you-like/">the last time I did this</a> I did say it was S4. Oops.</p>
