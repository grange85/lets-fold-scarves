  content: "Somewhere near the top of my list is the scene at the Magic Box in \"Family\"
    where the Scoobies all line up behind Buffy in support of Tara. So many great
    things about that scene, including the Niblet showing some of that Summers' backbone
    with her spunky \"and me\" (she is a hair puller, after all). \r\n\r\nPretty much
    the entire cast crammed into one screen cap. And then Spike steps up and exposes
    the fraud being attempted by Tara's family. Scoobies at their finest."

  content: I just re-watched The Chosen tonight and came upon your mention of the
    Scoobies in the school bantering... definitely one of the best moments.  I think
    I learned from you that this scene is a riff on the final shot of the first Buffy
    episode?  I read it somewhere - it just shows the writers' genius.

<p class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 26: Favourite Scooby Moment </strong></p></p>
<p class="posterous_autopost">This is barmy. There are hundreds of great Scooby moments. Even if you pare it down to the core four that is a lot of moments.</p><br />
However, the scene in "Doppelgangland" comes to mind when the others think Willow has been turned into a vampire and she turns up is very funny. And <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2010/07/31/30-days-of-buffy-day-26-favorite-scooby-moment/">Andy is right</a>: "Hush" is also fab.</p>
<p>The scene in Sunnydale High School before the final battle as all four talk and depart is a great moment.</p>
