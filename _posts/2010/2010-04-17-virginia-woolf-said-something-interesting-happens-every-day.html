<div class='posterous_autopost'>After thoroughly enjoying <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hours/" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Hours</span></a> when it was shown on TV, I was delighted to see a DVD copy of it in our holiday cottage loaded with extras. The documentary on Virginia Woolf was very good and I was struck by Nigel Nicolson&#39;s remark that Woolf told him that "something interesting happens every day". I&#39;m going to see if that is true. Also, i need to actually read some Woolf.<br />
<div class="gmail_quote"> <br />Today, several interesting things happened: we came home after our holiday and the sky was totally clear except for one autogyro and one small prop plane. We also visited <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/4529385626/" target="_blank">Cockerham Sands</a> where a friend of Helen&#39;s has just moved to. She doesn&#39;t seem to mind being a few miles south of a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/moley75/4529385070/" target="_blank">nuclear power station</a>. I wouldn&#39;t either: the house was lovely.<br /> </div>
