<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Midnight</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Claudette Colbert  was a fabulous comedian who seemed to have chemistry with any male actor. Imagine how great she might have been if  she had just relaxed a little regarding her profile. She also wore a lot of  make-up. I can&rsquo;t imagine her posing as a twelve year old devoid (ish) of face paint  like Ginger Rogers did in <em>The Major and the Minor</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I adore Mary  Astor. I find her sympathetic no matter how unsympathetic she is supposed to be and Andy and I decided she was  better looking than Claudette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first moment I  realised I was going to like this film occured with Colbert&rsquo;s first  appearance looking tiny and gorgeous in a gold dress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unfortunately, the  film dragged on too long and I certainly could have done without the divorce court scenes and Colbert saying she  would submit to a spanking if only her husband said he loved her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rex O&rsquo;Malley was  hilarious as the gay friend. John Barrymore was fine as the husband despite his eyes wandering around looking for  his lines. Don Ameche was an attractive leading man but he was never one of my favourites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Favourite scenes:  Colbert on the phone to her &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; and Colbert convincing the others that Ameche was insane: &ldquo;what is the  matter with you people!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It&rsquo;s a millipede!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a whole load  of  caterpillars!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br /></span></p>
<p>It's a right profile!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>The Major and  the Minor</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This film was a  hit for me until it got to the military academy and its icky premise fell off the bar and into the pit of  tasteless and disturbing. The first boy&rsquo;s Maginot Line stuff was a route to rape and  Kirby&rsquo;s stupidity was annoying. If the film had explored that he was attracted  to Ginger as her mother as well as the child then the film might have got  away with an explanation that he loved what was inside her not just the  exterior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I do particularly like Ginger&rsquo;s  five or ten minutes as an eleven year old at the station and on the train particularly when she conceals a  cigarette in her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>High Art</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was  excellent. I get that some people are dismayed that it&rsquo;s a lesbian film in which an unhappy lesbian dies fuelling the dead  lesbian clich&eacute;. However, the sexuality of the leading characters is no more important that the sexuality of the characters in some other arty film. I do wish  it had had a happy ending despite the fact they were a poorly matched couple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Patricia Clarkson  wobbled along the line of amazing and a little bit silly which is a shame because she was close to stealing the  film from Radha Mitchell and Ally Sheedy who really impressed me. The former  also looked like Cillian Murphy so if they could play siblings soon that  would be great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">And I liked that  Syd wasn&rsquo;t having any of her boyfriend&rsquo;s criticism of her work and interests. I am fed up with the b/f or husband  either being a boor about such matters or being portrayed as being right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The most moving  moment was Syd weeping as she confesses that she loves Lucy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>A Letter to  Three Wives</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Joseph Mankiewicz  had a good 1949 and 1950 with this and <em>All About Eve</em> and judging by how I feel today, I think I prefer <em>A  Letter to Three Wives</em>, it was that good. It starts off slowly but when Deborah says  &ldquo;great leveleller&rdquo; I knew we were onto a winner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The use of sound  effects was a little cheesy but was also unusual and rather quirky which was cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fabulous rude dialogue: "</span>Sadie may not realize it, but whether or not she thinks she's listening,  she's being penetrated."</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I liked George and Rita the most. George was witty and Kirk Douglas played him perfectly. Rita at first seemed best  friend material until the fact that she was radio writer proved to be very  important. George&rsquo;s attitude was very modern (so modern, in fact, that I find it  hard to imagine him in a film in these reactionary times) and, although I could  have done without him shoving Rita into her seat, I did like what he said. He  was less concerned that he wasn&rsquo;t the main provider than he was with his  wife selling out. He didn&rsquo;t mind her earning more than him he just wanted her  to be proud about how he was earning it and not kow-towing to commercialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Coincidentally,  the narrators of this and <em>All About Eve</em> are called Addie and Addison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Come Next  Spring</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I adored this when  I was younger but hearing Ann Sheridan taking and getting the blame for men&rsquo;s behaviour was not nice in my &ldquo;oh  my god, feminism has ruined everything for me&rdquo; days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ann and Steve  Cochran made a hot couple. I liked her a lot, she had so much oomph! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I like Steve in  this but I have this feeling that he was totally sleazy in real life but I don&rsquo;t know the details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Night and the  Fog</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In general, I  don&rsquo;t like film noir not even noir set in post war, pre Festival of Britain London so I don&rsquo;t know why I tried. The wrestling/fight scene was bloody unpleasant as was every single  character except Gene and Hugh and they were boring.</span></p>
