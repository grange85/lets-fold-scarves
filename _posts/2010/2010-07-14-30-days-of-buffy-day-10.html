  content: "S7. It was pretty dismal on several fronts, a few of which are:\r\n\r\n-crazy
    Spike living in the school basement. \r\n-Giles being all whiny and losing his
    faith in Buffy, after everything they've been through together \r\n-the Potentials\r\n-Kennedy
    (who wasn't fit to wash Tara's undies) and Willow\r\n-Buffy, hearing how Robin's
    slayer mother was killed by a vampire and not immediately suspecting Spike\r\n-Dawn
    and Spike having about 2 scenes together all season\r\n-Xander reacting to Anya's
    death as if she'd just broken a nail\r\n\r\nThe best thing about S7, IMO, was
    Andrew. He was hilarious all season (and he got to wear Dawnie's football helmet
    and ride with Spike)"

  content: 'Yes to all that. And the season did have three episodes that I enjoyed
    greatly and would be happy to watch again: "Same Time, Same Place", "Selfless"
    and  "Conversations with Dead People".'

<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 10: Least Favourite Season </strong><strong> </strong></div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost"></div></p>
<div class="posterous_autopost">This is easy. While all seasons have their ups and downs there is only one season that produced commentary from me that <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2009/10/05/it-turns-out-everybody-loves-a-good-goats-tongue-rock-groups-covens-and-greek-cookbooks/comment-page-1/#comment-1154">drove someone to comment on my blog</a> in a less than nice way. So for that reason and maybe some others it is <strong>S7</strong>.</div></p>
