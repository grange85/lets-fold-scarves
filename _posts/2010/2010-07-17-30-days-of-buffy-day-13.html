<div class="posterous_autopost"><strong>Day 13: Favourite Potential Slayer</strong></p>
<p>Who are the candidates? Annabelle, Chao-Ahn, Eve, </a></a>Caridad, Kennedy, Vi, Molly, Chloe, Rona, Amanda or Dawn (can I choose Dawn?).</p>
<p>OK, I can't have Dawn so that leaves only one and that is Amanda. It's not much of a competition but she was appealingly played by Sarah Hagan particularly in the scenes before anyone knew she was a potential.</p>
