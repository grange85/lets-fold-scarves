excerpt: "<em><strong>Glee</strong></em> The first conclusion I drew from
  this series (I have watched the first four episodes and skimmed the next two) is
  that modern pop songs have pretty objectionable lyrics. Not even Jessalyn Gilsig's
  valiant attempt can make hysterical Terri at all palatable. And that the hilarious
  lines given to Sue and the impeccable delivery of them by Jane Lynch are not enough
  to sustain a series. There is also way too much miming and too much reliance on
  stereotypes to subvert the stereotypes. I know that I'd rather see something approximating
  real people?* I like Lea Michele whose nose is a pleasure to look at even from inside
  a toilet.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2662\" title=\"glee\"

  alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"258\" />\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Dollhouse</strong></em>
  S2 went through a glorious patch with \"The Attic\" being the pinnacle and then
  it crashed to Earth. I've <a href=\"https://www.moley75.co.uk/category/dollhouse/\">already
  written</a> about what I have liked and disliked about it but I will add that
  Mellie/Madeline/November's death was shoddily done and dismayed me immensely.\r\n\r\n<img

  boyd - silly faces\" src=\"/images/uploads/2010/02/dollhouse.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"258\" />\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Carniv&agrave;le</strong></em>
  S2 began with an episode that cleared up any lingering doubts that this series is
  bonkers. I couldn't stand Libby at first and now her sadness is so heartbreaking.
  Amy Madigan has become more and more compelling as Iris. I'm going to miss Professor
  Lodz.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2672\" title=\"Carnivale

  alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"288\" />\r\n\r\n*<em><strong>Community</strong></em>
  On <a href=\"http://laughingwild.blogspot.com/\">maurinsky</a>'s
  recommendation, we started watching this and after three episodes we are hooked.
  The seven main characters are all interesting, and funny, and rounded. And I ever
  thought I would ever write this but Chevy Chase is hilarious. Joel McHale has something
  of the Anthony Head about him (but not in this cast photo).\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter

  alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"350\" />\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Nurse Jackie</em></strong>
  I still like this a lot but after 10 episodes I don't understand the following point
  about Jackie. Why did she start work at All Saints and conceal her marriage? Do
  we find out? Also, I didn't believe for a second that she couldn't get that ring
  off. Also, minor thing but she whacks her middle finger - should have shot that
  again. But I simply love Edie Falco and Eve Best and Merritt Wever. They are all
  awesome in their own ways.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2666\"
  title=\"Nurse Jackie - Merritt Wever as Zoey - Eve Best as Dr O'Hara - Zoey wants
  her stethescope back\" src=\"/images/uploads/2010/02/nurse-jackie-01.jpg\"

  src=\"/images/uploads/2010/02/edie-falco.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" width=\"470\" height=\"313\" />And Edie Falco is hot with that butch
  cut.</p>\r\n<strong><em>The Good Wife</em></strong> I started watching
  this on a whim on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od\">4oD</a>
  and I hooked but I don't really know why! It's a legal drama and I don't particularly
  like legal dramas (not since <em>Crown Court</em> anyway) and she always wins.
  And yet... It's quite amusing that both this and <em>Nurse Jackie</em> are vehicles
  for actors coming off <a href=\"http://www.erheadquarters.com/index2.htm\">big</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.the-sopranos.com/\">big</a> shows and presumably
  for most folks the actors come with a lot of baggage. Luckily for me I am oblivious.\r\n\r\n<img
  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661\" title=\"Good Wife - Christine Baranski
  and Julianna Margulies\" src=\"/images/uploads/2010/02/good-wife42.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"340\" />\r\n\r\nI am always aware that I almost
  exclusively comment on American programmes which suggests I don't watch British
  productions. However I do but they are mostly documentaries like (and this is from
  the past year only): <em>A History of Christianity</em>, <em>The Art of Russia</em>,
  <em>Games Britannia</em>, <em>Shooting the War</em>, <em>Life</em>,
  <em>The Victorians</em>, <em>How Earth Made Us</em>, etc. All made by or
  for the BBC and they are why I gladly pay my licence fee."

  content: "Glad to hear you're enjoying Community.  It's been a real pleasure watching
    that one this year.  I've been a big Joel McHale fan since back in the 90s when
    he was on a local Seattle version of Saturday Night Live.\r\n\r\nThe Abed character
    is hilarious."
