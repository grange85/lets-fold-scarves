  content: I loved this movie as a kid. I also had the TV movie sequels on tape. As
    for Hayley Mills' accent, I think she does slightly better than Lindsay Lohan
    did in the 1998 remake.

<p><em><strong>The Parent Trap</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1191" title="The Parent Trap - Hayley Mills and Susan Henning-Schutte" src="/images/uploads/2008/10/parent-trap.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="300" /></p>
<p>This was about ten years too long. Hayley Mills was superb as the twins carrying the film effortlessly and charmingly (although accents weren't her strong point). Brian Keith was all right. Maureen O'Hara was absolutely fine except for the fact she appeared to be two different people: the one in Boston bore no resemblance to the one in California. Perhaps she should have played the twins.</p>
<p>PS I love Mac's Grab tool.</p>
