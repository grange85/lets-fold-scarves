  content: I think the other one I was thinking of was <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rosemelberg"
    rel="nofollow">Rose Melberg</a> who drummed for Gaze but that makes them an

<p>How totally cool is it to see Honey Lantree banging the drums in this clip from <em>Pop Gear</em> aka <em>Go Go Mania</em>? It's 1964 folks! The Honeycombs were produced by Joe Meek who was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dahty1E1yzk">barking</a>.</p>

<p>Following on: Meg White, Karen Carpenter, Moe Tucker, Debbi Peterson, Georgia Hubley, Janet Weiss, Lindy Morrison, Kate Schellenbach, and, of course, loads of other artists I am ignorant of. I would be really interested to hear of any other female drummers <em>not</em> in all-women bands.</p>
