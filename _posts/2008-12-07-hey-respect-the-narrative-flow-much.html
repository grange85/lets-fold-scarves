<p><strong>Doublemeat Palace</strong> (Jane Espenson)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" title="Buffy in uniform in Doublemeat Palace" src="/images/uploads/2008/12/dpalace-buffy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;The workers are the tools that shape America.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good to know...I was kinda feeling like a tool. And now I know why.&rdquo;</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is not a great episode and it&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Beer Bad&rdquo; (take that sentence any way you like). It is written by Jane Espenson so it does have some very funny lines. However, and actually, after perusing the transcript available online (and those transcripts are extremely valuable &ndash; thanks <a href="http://www.englishchick.com/grammar/">Joan</a>) I realise it&rsquo;s not that funny but SMG does her bit to make it all seem better.</p></p>
<p>Xander&rsquo;s line &ldquo;I think you're seeing demons where there's just life.&rdquo; sums up season six in that a lot of the season is concerned with Buffy&rsquo;s struggles with ordinary life.</p>
<p>Sex in an alleyway outside a burger bar &ndash; can Spuffy sex get any more sordid? What? It can?</p>
<p>Amy&rsquo;s behaviour is reprehensible but, on the other hand, the actual de-ratting did seem awfully easy in the end. Amy has missed three years of her life &ndash; the final year of high school and two college years &ndash; I&rsquo;d be peed off too. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. Sharp argument you got there. Were you on the debate team? I forget. I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have nothing else to say except that Xander looked good in this episode particularly when embarrassed.</p></p>
