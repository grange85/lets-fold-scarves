<p>I am quite taken with Vanessa Engle's work. Her series <em>Jews</em> was fascinating and insightful and understated. She lets her subjects do the talking while she asks seemingly innocuous questions off-screen.</p>
<p>Her earlier series <em>Lefties</em> featured a programme devoted to radical feminists ("<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/lefties2.shtml">Angry Wimmin</a>") like Julie Bindel and Sheila Jeffreys. I liked it a lot. I could understand some of the rather extreme attitudes from a time when the Yorkshire Ripper was abroad and women were being asked to stay off the streets while men were not, even though no woman was perpetrating the crimes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I rather excited that Vanessa Engle is revisiting the subject of feminism in a new series for my favourite TV channel, BBC Four. The series is called <em>Women</em> and there is more information <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/20/viewpoints.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, I am also excited to think of Helena Bonham Carter playing Enid Blyton and Jane Horrocks playing Gracie Fields.</p>
