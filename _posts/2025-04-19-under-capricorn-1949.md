I can never stop staring at Ingrid Bergman. She was extraordinary.

I am surprised at how much I liked Michael Wilding in this and in Stage Fright. He was really charming.

I liked Hitchcock's camera work and the story was intriguing albeit not a million times different from Gaslight. I also liked its unusual setting but a few days after watching it it has receded quite a bit from my memory.
