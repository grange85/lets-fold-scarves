    The "funny" thing is that this was apparently the "apology" episode Marti Noxon was forced into writing when it was noticed that the "forgive your abuser" message of "I Only Have Eyes For You" didn't exactly match-up with the anti-domestic violence PSA that SMG did for that episode.  Marti's a bit better here (at least Pete gets his, and how), but as you noticed, she's still not exactly sympathetic to the victims.

    It doesn't help that Sarah plays the bathroom scene like a straight PSA, that she doesn't show any recognition of the parallels being drawn in the dialogue between Pete/Debbie and Angel/Buffy.  Frustrating, because she's so good in the scenes with DB.  (I really believe she was steeling herself to stake Angel before he said her name.)

    And the pacing sucks, there's a pointless misdirect when the camera acts as though somebody is watching Pete/Debby go into the storage room (nobody is), Buffy is a straight-up bitch to both Giles and Willow (her monologue to Platt's corpse about how she can't tell them Angel's back because she's skeered that Giles/Willow would hurt Po' Widdle Angel [Willow??? Biggest-Buffy/Angel-'shipper-in-the-universe Willow? Wtf, Buff?] is sickening) and Oz is so repeatedly cold to Willow that it would take a lot more than a Pez Witch to make me forgive him.

    Xander is directed to look like a total goof-off [in the shooting script he just dozes off accidentally, rather than preparing for a nap, as shot], Cordelia gets mocked unfairly, and they both get ditched out of the episode halfway through.  Giles is a hypocrite who blames Xander, but doesn't say a word to Buffy when **she** is asleep on the job the next day, and how come HE isn't doing Oz-watch, when he's the only one with a legitimate excuse to be in the Library overnight?  (Faith doesn't even go to the school!  If security found her in there, she'd get arrested!)

    Only Willow and Faith (and Scott Hope) get out of this pile with any dignity.  Worst episode of S1-S3, easily.

<p>The main problem with this episode is the single line "don&#39;t get hit". Yikes. I understand that as the conversation progresses it becomes clear that Buffy is projecting and, yes, essentially she behaved like Debbie. However, that first line to Debbie couldn&#39;t be more victim blaming (don&#39;t put yourself in a position where you get hit - just walk away (as if it was that easy)) and the episode doesn&#39;t really recover from that in my eyes.<br></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.dvrcv.org.au/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-and-domestic-violence-2/">This article</a> by Ada Conroy was one of the few that I could find quickly that shares my dismay with the message of the episode and there is also <a href="http://www.atpobtvs.com/philos.html#fda">this</a> (though I don&#39;t know who the author is).<br></p>
<p> <br>Unfortunately, the funniest moment in the episode is a violent one when a startled Faith gives Buffy a backhander - "Hey, Buffy, don&#39;t get hit!" I am pleased to say that there is a gif of this out there and it is a gift - thanks, <a href="http://goodbyepiccadilly.tumblr.com/">goodbyepiccadilly</a>!<br></p>

<p><br>The second funniest moment is when Giles is downed by a tranquillizer dart - definitely bloody priceless.<br><br>
