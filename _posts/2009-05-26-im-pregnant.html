<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Meditations in an Emergency"</strong> (Matthew Weiner and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1958815/">Kater Gordon</a>)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1978" title="mad men - meditations in an emergency - father gill and peggy" src="/images/uploads/2009/05/miae.jpg" alt="mad men - meditations in an emergency - father gill and peggy" width="426" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p>This season ender doesn&rsquo;t have the power of &ldquo;The Wheel&rdquo; but it does have the best scene so far when Pete confesses to Peggy that he loves her and she tells him it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pete: I love you. And I want to be with you. What? Didn&rsquo;t you know that?<br />
Peggy: Pete. I could have had you in my life forever if I wanted to.<br />
Pete: What do you mean?<br />
Peggy: I could have had you. I could have shamed you into being with me. But I didn&rsquo;t want to.<br />
Pete: I don&rsquo;t understand.<br />
Peggy: You got me pregnant. I had a baby. And I gave it away.<br />
Pete: What?<br />
Peggy: I had your baby. And I gave it away.</blockquote><br />
It was utterly gripping and it was this scene (following on from her scene with Father Gill) that has convinced me that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jan/25/elisabeth-moss-interview-mad-men">Elisabeth Moss</a> is playing Peggy very well indeed. Father Gill is doing his job but I was so relieved that Peggy wasn&rsquo;t falling for his fearmongering despite the imminent apocalypse.</p>
<blockquote><p>Father Gill: Hell is serious and very real and unless you unburden yourself you cannot know peace.<br />
Peggy: I understand that, Father, but you&rsquo;re upsetting me right now.<br />
Father Gill: That is your guilt, Peggy. All that God wants is for you to reconcile with him. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you understand that this could be the end of the world and you could go to Hell?<br />
Peggy: I can&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the way God is. Good night, Father.</blockquote><br />
Betty spends the whole episode telling everyone she doesn&rsquo;t want the baby to no avail although the much missed Francine has more advice than most. I love Anne Dudek and I think a re-viewing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_Group"><em>The Book Group</em></a> is required. I also love Lois (Crista Flanagan). She is such a sweet character. I do like how actors in these tiny recurring roles sneak up on you in terms of affection. Pete&rsquo;s secretary Hildy is another favourite of mine (<a href="http://www.juliemcniven.net/home/index.php?location=resume">Julie McNiven</a> - "Stand-in/body double for Lindsay Lohan!" - excellent).</p>
<p>I had written a lot of stuff about casual sex but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. <a href="http://sepinwall.blogspot.com/2008/10/mad-men-matthew-weiner-q-for-season-two.html">Betty is pregnant, is confused about her marriage, and is drunk.</a> What would I do?</p>
<p>When Don comes to see Betty at the stables I was in two minds about whether I wanted her to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; or to say what she did say. Damn Don&rsquo;s charisma. Don&rsquo;s letter was a marvel and the moment when Joan tells Don that Betty wants him to come home made my heart leap.</p>
<p>What happens next? A jump in time again? I won't be waiting until 2010 to find out :-)</p>
