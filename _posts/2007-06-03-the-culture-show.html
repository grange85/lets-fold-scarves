<p><em>The Culture Show</em> used to be presented by a different presenter each week from a different location like Verity Sharp in Blackpool or Andrew Graham Dixon in Cullercoats or Charles Hazlewood in Skateraw in East Lothian. Now it is presented by Lauren Laverne (who I like) from London's South Bank each and every week. And the last series was presented by LL from the same bar (or whatever) each and every week. <em>The Now Show</em> was produced from Birmingham but when it comes on air again it will be broadcast from London.</p>
<p>How can the BBC ever escape claims of London-bias if it carries on doing things like this? Moving the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6708383.stm">Children's and Sport's departments</a> to Manchester will never change public perception of bias unless what it sees on screen is clearly diverse. And <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2036342,00.html">Lauren Laverne's accent</a> isn't enough.</p>
