<p>Andy and I watched <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/sing.html">Singin&rsquo; in the Rain</a> last night (over Kiss Me Kate). By the end, we had mutually decided against received wisdom that it is one of the best films ever made.</p>
<p>The <em>Broadway Melody Ballet</em> is shoehorned into the final third. It has no real connection with the films of the twenties (except it is set in the twenties) because it doesn&rsquo;t resemble film musicals of that period. I don&rsquo;t really like it anyway (it hints at the pretentiousness of <em>An American in Paris</em>) except for a stunning <a href="http://legs.free.fr/">Cyd Charisse</a> shimmying around Gene Kelly. I can&rsquo;t imagine such a statuesque woman being allowed near the big screen now but, my word, no wonder my dad remembers her fondly.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not that there aren&rsquo;t great bits in the film (the flashbacks at the premiere, <em>Make 'em Laugh</em>, sound comes to Monumental Pictures, the preview of <em>The Duelling Cavalier</em>, etc) but quite a lot is average fare (I really want to like the cute teenage Debbie Reynolds but she doesn't have the presence to match Gene Kelly's overbearing personality). All right, <em>Singin&rsquo; in the Rain</em> is brilliantly indelible but otherwise? <em>Moses Supposes</em>? <em>Beautiful Girl</em>? <em>All I Do Is Dream of You</em>? Jean Hagen steals the show with her marvellous performance as Lina: "I can&rsquo;t make love to a bush", dubbing herself as Kathy Selden who is meant to be dubbing her, "I can shoo", "I ain&rsquo;t people".</p>
