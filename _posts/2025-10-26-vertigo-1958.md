My problem with Vertigo is that I'm supposed to admire it but I don't. I think it's a nasty story with one of my least favourite actors (Stewart) being nasty. He's nasty to Midge even though he is aware of her feelings and he's cruel to Judy who is inexplicably in love with him. I get the themes of masculinity and control and the inability of men to see women as people in their own right but I don't actually want to watch it! Therefore my favourite part of the film is watching Scotty following Madeleine around San Francisco when everything is intriguing and pretty.
