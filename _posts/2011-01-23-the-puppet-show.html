  content: "I love Angel as a puppet in \"Smile Time\". The thought of Angellus as
    a wee little puppet man is hilarious. \r\n\r\nReturning to this puppet episode,
    though, how the hell did Giles allow himself to get strapped into a guillotine?
    That would never happen to The Ripper...would it?"

<p>Why is there a public phone backstage in Sunnydale High?<br><br>This was a fine MOTW episode with strong dialogue and a superb first appearance by Armin Shimerman as Principal Snyder.<br><br>Buffy forgets to put on her trousers a couple of times.<br></p>
<p><br>I&#39;m quite pleased the smug Scoobies have to take part in the talent show just because they were smug and laughing at Giles.<br><br>There are some clever things going on in this such as the cutting between separate conversations to move things along quickly (there is a technical term for this, isn&#39;t there?); the low level camera work; and, maybe the most hilarious shot in <i>Buffy</i> ever:<br></p>
