<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Mountain King"</strong> (Matthew Weiner and Robin Veith)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1972" title="Mad Men - The Mountain King - Anna and Don" src="/images/uploads/2009/05/mountain-king.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The Mountain King - Anna and Don" width="462" height="300" /></p>
<p>This was an action-packed episode, well, packed. What with Peggy&rsquo;s new office, Betty berating Sarah Beth, Don and Anna then and now, Joan&rsquo;s rape, the Popsicle and Clearasil accounts, and Peggy cracking a joke, there was a ton of great stuff to digest.</p>
<p>We were taken once again away from the New York world that we are used to but unlike &ldquo;The Jet Set&rdquo; the scenes in San Pedro, CA, totally worked.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;s relationship with Anna was fascinating and the actor (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1561547/">Melinda Page Hamilton</a>) was instantly likeable. Dick/Don&rsquo;s excitement over meeting Elizabeth was a little overplayed by Jon Hamm but the line &ldquo;I just like the way she laughs, and the way she looks at me&rdquo; just killed me with its irony.</p>
<p>I was concerned that the child playing the piano was Don&rsquo;s son which was a complication I wasn&rsquo;t interested in seeing.</p>
<p>Peggy scoring Freddy&rsquo;s office just by asking was fabulous and seeing her behind the desk joking with Pete (&ldquo;How the hell did you swing this?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleeping with Don. It&rsquo;s really working out.&rdquo;) and drinking whisky was very exciting.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s changing relationship with her daughter Sally was a pleasure to see though I was 21st century horrified when she put her in the cupboard as a punishment. However, she treated her better later on by giving her riding boots (and hence riding lessons) and telling her the truth about Don was a great leap forward.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2009/05/08/betty-on-the-phone-with-sarah-beth/">words</a> during her phone call to Sarah Beth were harsh but I see disappointment in Betty&rsquo;s reaction. Sarah Beth failed to be faithful despite what she has said to Betty about her marriage and Betty was disappointed.</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s rape by her perfect fianc&eacute; was pretty hard to watch. Her face as she looked away into the distance was heartbreaking &ndash; Christina Hendricks is amazing and I was sad that she wasn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.entil2001.com/series/firefly/season1dvd/ff1-6.html">Mrs Reynolds</a> at this point because then she could beat the shit out of him. Sadly, in real-life, kick-ass women don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
