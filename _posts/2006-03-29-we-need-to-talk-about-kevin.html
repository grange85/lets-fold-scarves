<p>Half of this novel by <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/authorintro/index.asp?authorid=27687">Lionel Shriver</a> is stunning, thought provoking, insightful and dowright uncomfortable. However, it over reaches itself and descends into incredulity. I coped with six year old Kevin in nappies and <em>not</em> in therapy but reading about a parent who not just suspected but knew that their son was torturing his sister and did nothing is not believeable (not written this way anyway). The lost of an eye and still nothing doing is just daft.</p></p>
<p>This is a powerful book but only for half of it.<br />
