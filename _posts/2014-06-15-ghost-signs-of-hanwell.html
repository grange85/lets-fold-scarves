<p>Hanwell has several ghost signs.</p>
<p>These two are on the back of buildings that fronted the Uxbridge Road. They are visible from Station Road and presumably were there to encourage potential shoppers coming from the direction of the station. The buildings are now occupied by an accountant and a secondhand car showroom.</p>

<p>This one is on Boston Road and certainly made me snigger the first time I noticed it. I like that it is still a shop albeit of an entirely different kind.</p>

<p>I like this one. It isn't a painted sign but it is certainly a ghostly presence. There was a Barclay's bank on the Uxbridge Road in my memory but part of the building is now a Domino's Pizza delivery store.</p>
