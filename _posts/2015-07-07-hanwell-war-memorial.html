<p>I've always wondered why Hanwell doesn't have a war memorial. I guess it is something to do with the Hanwell Urban District Council being small and then being absorbed into Ealing Council in 1926. I wonder if the Ealing war memorial <em>does</em> include Hanwell war dead. I think I have written myself into a project.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is a memorial to the boy scouts of Hanwell who fell in both wars. It and the surrounding trees are&nbsp;in Churchfields Recreation Ground near the Wharncliffe Viaduct.</p>
