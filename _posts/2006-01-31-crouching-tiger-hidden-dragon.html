<p>Knowing Adam's love of Star Wars we naturally thought he might like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> and we weren't wrong. It was a little bit saucier than I remembered but he was oblivious and he always shuts his eyes during kissing scenes anyway. He didn't quite follow what was going on but reminding him of Star Wars parallels kept him on track. The amazing fight scenes are awesome for any age group so they would have kept him interested anyway; a particular favourite of his was the fight in the restaurant when Jen Yu beats all comers.</p>
<p>My favourite is the one between Jen Yu and Yu Shu Lien. There is something awesome about watching two women beating the shit out of each other a la Faith and Buffy and the fighting between <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706/">Michelle Yeoh</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955471/">Zhang Ziyi</a> (so gorgeous that Andy involuntarily informed us that "she's lovely") are fantastic. What's also good to see is that the majority of the work is done by the actresses themselves and not conspicuously by stunt doubles.</p>
