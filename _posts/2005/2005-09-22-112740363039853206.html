<p>&#8220;Millions&#8221; by Frank Cottrell Boyce &#8211; a delightful little story which was very funny in parts. It was cleverly and subtly written (it was never explained why Damian kept asking about a St Maureen but I bet it was his mother&#8217;s name). The line that Damian was his mother&#8217;s miracle made me weep. Super story.</p></p>
