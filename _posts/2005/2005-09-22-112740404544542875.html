<p>"Sidetracked" by Henning Mankell - what a disappointment - good reviews on Amazon - recommended by a friend - but - no suspense, no mystery, a rather unbelievable plot, dull meanderings about Wallender's private life. It was a page turner despite being no good - I think I was desperate to get it finished.</p>
