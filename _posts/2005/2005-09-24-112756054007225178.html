<p>"Frasier:  Roz's Krantz and Gouldenstein Are Dead" - a good episode which could have veered into sentimentality since it was partly set in a old people's home. Lois Smith was particularly good as Moira. Since we have been rewatching Frasier on DVD I have noticed just how many jokes were made about Roz's promiscuity by Niles and it's rather tiresome. <strong><br />
