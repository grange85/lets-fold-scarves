<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Ground State"</strong> (<a href="http://www.triviaguide.net/mere-smith/">Mere Smith</a>)</p>

<p>I thought after viewing this that I had quite enjoyed it as a whole but when I put together a list of pluses and minuses I realised that what I had enjoyed was Gwen: one of the more memorable guest stars.</p>
<p>Minuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>too little Cordelia</li>
<li>I like Amy Acker in <em>Dollhouse</em> but in <em>Angel</em> she is distractingly thin and she plays an annoying character <em>even</em> when she isn't whining at/to Gunn</li>
<li>the flip chart scene</li>
<li>there is zero chemistry between Fred and Gunn</li>
<li>Wesley and Lilah talking and loving at the same time was icky</li>
<li>the weird decision to set Angel and Wesley's important conversation right next to some noisy machinery</li>
<li>Dinza asking Angel about whether he misses the sound of waves because why would he when he was at the bottom of the ocean?</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>Pluses:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's nice to see a man going down on a woman in mainstream television</li>
<li>I'm glad they revealed that Lilah did know what Wesley was up to</li>
<li> Gwen</li>
<li> David Boreanaz's performance was thoroughly likeable throughout</li><br />
</ul><br />
