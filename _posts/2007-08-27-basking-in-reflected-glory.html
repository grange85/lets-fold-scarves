<p>I highly recommend a very readable book by <a href="http://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/">David Jennings</a> called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1857883985?ie=UTF8&tag=musicarcades-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1857883985">Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll</a></em>. It is a look at how people use the Internet to listen to music, to find new music and to make new friends.</p>

I'm feeling warm from all that glory. Seriously, he should be proud of what he has done over the years, I know that I am. David has posted <a href="http://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/2007/08/fan-communities.html">this</a> rather wonderful post profiling Andy and <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/">A Head Full of Wishes</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>
