I have to recommend the <a href="http://www.dailylit.com/faq.html">DailyLit</a> where you can sign up to read short chunks of public domain literature sent to you daily by e-mail. I am signed up to <em><a href="http://charlesdickenspage.com/bleakhouse.html">Bleak House</a></em> (because this is the only way I'll get through a Dickens novel), <em><a href="http://colemanzone.com/Time_Machine_Project/TimeMachinePrint.htm">The Time Machine</a></em> (because I like Wells) and <em><a href="http://community.middlebury.edu/~beyer/courses/previous/ru351/novels/UGMan/ugman.html">Notes from (the) Underground</a></em> (because it sounded strange - and it is).</p>
<p>A quote from <em>Notes from Underground</em>:</p>
<p>"I am forty years old now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age.  To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral.  Who does live beyond forty?  Answer that, sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows."</p>
