<p>My word, I have just discovered somebody is reading this...well, I suppose that was the point!</p>
<p>Anyway, I have been very slack recently, in fact, ever since my OU course finished and I haven't been up here looking for excuses not to study.</p>
<p>For my book club we read The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks which I remember reading when it was published twenty years or so ago. I was taken with it then but now it feels rather tiresome, sensational and poorly plotted.</p>
<p>I did enjoy The Dinosaur Hunters by Deborah Cadbury which is an account of the rivalry between Gideon Mantell and Richard Owen in the 19th century.</p>
<p>I have just finished Souls in the Great Machine by Sean McMullen, a science fiction novel set in a future where technology is on a level with the 16th century and The Call intermittently drags all mammals south east unless they are tied down. It was full of fantastic ideas but the characterisation was weak and the plotting all over the place. Still, I have ordered the sequel.</p>
<p>I was still persevering with Lost but only in a "I know this is crap but I need to know what happens" way.</p>
<p>Andy and I are currently on the fourth Season of Buffy which has had some of the worst episodes ("Beer bad") and some of the best ("Something blue" and "Hush").</p>
<p>I have Firefly waiting for us - on Maureen's recommendation I went to see Serenity and I loved it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the release day of Aerial by Kate Bush. On Thursday and Friday, I listened to all seven albums and I was blown away by how amazing she is. However, The Red Shoes is by far the weakest. I used to say The Dreaming  was my favourite but I hate to be predictable but The Kick Inside is probably my favourite now.</p>
<p>1. The Kick Inside<br />
2. The Dreaming<br />
3. Hounds of Love<br />
4. Lionheart (I even love Oh England My Lionheart now)<br />
5. Never For Ever<br />
6. The Sensual World (Heads We're Dancing and Deeper Understanding are what drag this down)<br />
7. The Red Shoes (over produced)</p>
