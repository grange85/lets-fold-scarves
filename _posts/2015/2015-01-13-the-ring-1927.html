<p>The story was terrible with the dullest, most unbelievable love triangle. There was no chemistry between Jack and Nellie and her change of allegiance at the end was as unmotivated as the rest of her behaviour throughout the film.</p>
<p>However, despite this, the film was a lot of fun to watch. The fine looking leads gave equally fine performances. But it was the extras that made it so enjoyable. The fairground and boxing scenes looked authentic, there was great trick photography for the Albert Hall, a thoroughly delightful jazzy dance at a party, inventive camera angles, and a variety of special effects.</p>
