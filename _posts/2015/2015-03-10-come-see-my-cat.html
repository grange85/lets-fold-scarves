  content: I love cats, too. A few years ago you write about how much you liked British
    actor , Alan MacNaughtan. I'm a great fan of his work as well. Do you know of
    any group who are also fans of Mr. MacNaughtan ?

<p>I love this quirky graffiti that you can see just before (or after) Berwick Upon Tweed on the east coast line. I've tried several times to capture it and have failed to get a useable shot but this time it was perfect.</p>
