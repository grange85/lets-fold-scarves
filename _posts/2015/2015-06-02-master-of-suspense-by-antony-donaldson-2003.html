<p>Hidden in a courtyard in the redeveloped Gainsborough Studios in Hoxton is this sculpture of Alfred Hitchcock in weathering steel (i.e. steel that rusts to form a protective layer) by Antony Donaldson. It dominates the courtyard and reminds me of a combination of Buddharupa and of a president on Mount Rushmore. </p></p>
