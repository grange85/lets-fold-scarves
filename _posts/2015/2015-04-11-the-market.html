<p>I may have lived here nearly 20 years but it was only today that my attention was arrested by this sign for The Market at the top of Studley Grange Road. Essentially it means that SGR begins about 20 metres south of Boston Road. I'm intrigued by what was at the top of the road on the other side where the flats are - Victorian houses that were pulled down or maybe there were shops and other businesses there?</p>
