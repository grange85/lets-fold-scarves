The exception may be <em>The Lodger</em> but it is hard to be sure how I feel about it as a film since it is so familiar. I think it helped that <em>The Farmer's Wife</em> was based on a play so it already had a strong story with well-drawn characters. I thought it was very funny with some splendid performances. I have really enjoyed the two performances I have seen from Lillian Hall-Davis and it makes me sad even over eighty years later thinking of <a href="http://davidkfrasier.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/lillian-hall-davis-overkill-in-golders.html">her tragic end</a>. &nbsp;</p>
