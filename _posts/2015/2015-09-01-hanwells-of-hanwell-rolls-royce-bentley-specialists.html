    Andy,
    l lived in Hanwell as a lad 72 years ago, now live in South of france.
    have been back recently and l still can't find any rich people living in Hanwell, but that dealer is something else.
    best wishes graham brockton

<p>For as long as I can remember, this showroom has been selling secondhand luxury cars on the Uxbridge Road in Hanwell.</p>
<p>[Update] A recent revelation via the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ealingcinema">@EalingCinema</a> is that the building was once a cinema called the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/30082">Coronation Hall Picture Palace</a>, a rather grandiose name, I feel. Here it is on a map from 1914, and you can also see the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/30087">Grand Electric Theatre</a> (latterly the Tudor) on Cherington Road.</p>

<p>I have also found the listings for them in <a href="http://specialcollections.le.ac.uk/cdm/ref/collection/p16445coll4/id/8913">Kelly's Directory of Middlesex, 1914</a>.</p>
