<p>I'm not a fan of romantic films and I generally don't care a wit for love triangles and if the points of the triangle are as desperately dull as they are in this, I definitely don't care.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to find reasons to like this or moments of genius because of the director but I'm failing. Sorry, Alfred, but this is down around position 52.</p>
