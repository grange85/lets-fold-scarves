<p>Wow, rather like Buffy being a freshman, that was awkward. Getting back into the Buffyverse wasn't as smooth as I assumed it would be. Being re-immersed in a pop/culture world where Buffy references Dada and Xander knows about the Renaissance but Buffy doesn't is a bit of a shock. It's very stylised and arch, and a bit irritating.</p>
<p>That said, I am looking forward to getting back into it because there are some crackers coming up by anybody's standards. I love, love, love several episodes of season 4.</p>
<p>Random notes: I remember liking Sunday more; Klimt versus Monet still funny; Willow has nice hair; would a lecturer be that mean?; when will I ever not wince at the word "bitch"?; the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ucla+campus&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIgdWbgKe1yAIVhTAaCh2ouwWc&biw=1386&bih=922">location for UCâ˜¼D is lovely</a>; watching it 16:9 with a technical eye does expose framing issues.</p>
