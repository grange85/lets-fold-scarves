<p>For his ninth (!) birthday treat, we are taking Adam and a few of his friends to see <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/review/0,1169,1453131,00.html">Aurelia's Oratorio</a> at the <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/pl149.html">Lyric</a>, Hammersmith. We three went last year and it was a fabulous experience. I can't wait to see it again.</p>
