<p>I really, really like this film. It's not that it's perfect, far from it: Jerry's sobering up is too neat and his return to Joan comes at a considerable price for her, but the first two thirds of it are tremendous. I found it enthralling, highly dramatic and very involving.</p>

<p>Sylvia Sidney and Fredric March were fantastic. I know there are many others who could have played Joan and Jerry but they would have been hard pushed to be <em>better</em>. I'm sure that a huge chunk of my enjoyment was based on their performances but the supporting cast were also excellent particularly George Irving as Joan's father.</p>
<p>Fredric March was a particular favourite of mine when I was younger which I had all but forgotten until I saw this and remembered how good he was. He comes across as intense but not without humour. He was also very attractive. </p>

<p>Talking of attractive, who could not find Sylvia Sidney totally appealing? I have only seen a handful of her films so I was blown away by her performance: full of depth and emotion. And OK, she was flipping gorgeous - those eyes, that sad face, that smile, and that full figure: gorgeous.</p>
