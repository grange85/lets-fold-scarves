<p>The new old entrance to Hanwell station on Station Approach. For years this entrance was closed which was thoroughly annoying for those of us who live in south Hanwell. It's amazing how much difference it makes when you have a train to catch. <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2014/10/09/the-closed-exit-to-station-road-at-hanwell-station/">It also improves the interior.</a></p>
