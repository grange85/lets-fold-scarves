<p>This film from the thirties was more progressive than a film from the fifties. I know I'm getting ahead of myself but the way Doris Day's character is treated in the remake makes me shudder. So, back in 1934, the wife (Edna Best) actually saves her daughter using her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun">Chekhov's gun</a> expertise, which is a great moment in a film of moments rather than a film of sustained storytelling.</p>
<p>It is also a film with a great cast: icy Cicely Oates, charismatic Frank Vosper (who died after falling from a liner), "silly ass" Hugh Wakefield, wonderful Leslie Banks with his two faces, and, of course, Peter Lorre who may have learned his lines phonetically but it's his facial expressions that are memorable.</p>
<p>And then there's sweet Nova Pilbeam (who is actually really annoying when she puts her mother off clay pigeon shooting) but takes part in the sensitive (incongruously so) ending when the traumatised girl is reunited with her parents.</p>
