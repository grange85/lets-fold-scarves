<p>Despite the limited involvement of Hitchcock in this film, I quite fancied seeing this for historical and cultural reasons. A great deal of it was annoying, overlong, and not at all funny but I found Teddy Brown on the xylophone entertaining, there was the odd sight of The Three Eddies - three black men in blackface (culture was awfully iffy for much of the 20th century) - performing two enjoyable routines, and I appreciated Cicely Courtneidge just for being Cicely Courtneidge.</p>
<p>The linking material with the efforts of Gordon Harker trying to get a decent TV reception was cutting edge stuff. <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7v7FTnT1wE4C&lpg=PA148&dq=low%20definition%20experimental%20service&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q=low%20definition%20experimental%20service&f=false">Experimental broadcasts had only begun the year before</a> and was only available for a handful of people in the south east of England. Personally, I'm surprised that anyone outside London and not very, very rich gave a hoot about the service.</p>
