<p>This was fun, well, the beginning and end sequences were anyway. The on-board love affairs were a little dull particularly since the princess wasn't good looking or a much of an actress. </p>
<p>The opening sequence is highly influenced by German cinema but very well done and the bit on the tube is very similar to one in Anthony Asquith's <em>Underground</em>.<a href="#footnote-1" id="r1">*</a> </p>
<p>Joan Barry was gorgeous and although a little stilted at first she soon became very endearing.<br />

<p>Henry Kendall and Barry had no chemistry but I don't think Kendall being gay was the issue, I  think the but the role was horrible. Why would sweet, brave, through the porthole first Emily stay with such a thoughtless idiot?</p>
<p>Their banter is also one-sided. I think we were supposed to find his attitude cheeky and amusing but it was leaden. She suggests a raft, he's dismissive, and then he suggests a raft. She doesn't say anything. No wit there, I'm afraid. </p>
<p>Were they has bad as each other? I think not. She is flattered by the commodore's attention but runs from any escalation whereas his head is turned as soon as he hears she's a princess and leaves her flat. And he only deigns to apologise when they are in a near death experience.</p>
<p>The sinking ship set was really effective and I loved the model moving down the Suez Canal.<br />

This absolutely must be the first time that someone has been shown on screen not just talking about using the lavatory but actually jiggling a little bit too.<br />

I don't think the cat cooking is racist. It was a practical thing to do and not every culture values cats in the way we do. It is hilarious and I say that as a cat lover.<br />

<p>There's been so much to write and think about, <em>Juno</em> and <em>The Skin Game</em> were pitiful in comparison, despite the middle of this being ordinary stuff.</p>
<p>Alma fact: co-scenario by<br />
Appearance by a cat or dog: ahem<br />
Transport: the tube, ships, a junk<br />

<p id="footnote-1"><a href="#r1">*</a>Which reminds me to ask, are any of Hitchcock's silent films a patch on Asquith's trio of <em>Shooting Stars</em>, <em>Underground</em>, and <em>A Cottage on Dartmoor</em>?</p></p>
