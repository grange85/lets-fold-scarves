<p>We were following a walk along the course of the New River in Highbury/Stoke Newington which was pretty dull along the culverted stretch along Petherton Road but this lovely representation of a zebra crossing with vigorously flashing Belisha beacons painted on the pavement of Church Path (overlooked by a black cat lounging on a window sill) was a nice surprise.</p>
