This building can be found in the middle of West Middlesex golf course in Dormers Wells, Southall. I think it looks like a old water company building but I can't find a reference to it. Edited to add: I did find a reference on a map from the 30s to confirm that this was a valve house so it is related to waterworks. The golf course is in the Brent river valley.</p>
