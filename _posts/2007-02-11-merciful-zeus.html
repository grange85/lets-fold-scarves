    I think Adam may be totally confused by <i>Restless</i> but the others are great suggestions (<i>Fear Itself</i> is my favourite Halloween one and <i>Doppelgangland</i> is one of my favourite ever).

    However, since you are fantastic singer I'm not sure you will ever really want to have a <i>OMWF</i> singalong with us though I was mighty impressed with Andy's storming performance as Spike. Apparently, I was a little less flat than SMG but I think Andy was being really really kind.

    If I ever make it over to England again, we really must get together for a Once More With Feeling singalong!

<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image336" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/omwf-title.jpg" alt="Once More With Feeling title" /></div>Hey, we did it. Andy attempted to play <em>Under Your Spell</em> on the piano for me but apparently it's not as easy as it looks. Anyway, Adam was interested and they started acting out scenes. A <em>Walk Through the Fire</em> read-through resulted in us putting the DVD on. And, now after 48 minutes of that and 10 minutes of the waking up scene in <em>Tabula Rasa</em>, the boy's a convert. I just need to sort out some suitable episodes for him. <em>Halloween</em>, <em>Pangs</em>, <em>Something Blue</em> come to mind. Any other suggestions?<br clear="all"/>
