  content: That's such a cute video. I never get tired of it. I think it's that sort
    of willingness to playfully interact with fans that really endears AB to her faithful
    admirers and it's not the sort of thing you see very often from people in her
    position. I love the way she points to the viewers at the end, like she's saying
    "you didn't think I'd do it, did you?"
