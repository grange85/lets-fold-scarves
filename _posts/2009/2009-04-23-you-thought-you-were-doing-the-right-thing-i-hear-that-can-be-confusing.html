  content: "I just re-watched \"Deep Down\" last night, and it is a pretty good episode.
    It might even be the best season premiere of the series, which I admit isn't saying
    much. \r\n\r\nI mentioned liking Gunn the other day, but I think I need to amend
    that statement to I like Gunn without Fred. Their relationship brings out some
    qualities in him that I find unpleasant. Though I do like their \"You know you
    can't say 'bro.'\" \"Can I say 'dawg'?\" exchange in this episode. And the Fluffy
    talk until Fred ruins it with her single entendre.\r\n\r\nHave you noticed the
    abundance of Wolfram &amp; Hart employees whose names begin with 'L'? Lilah, Linwood,
    Lindsey, Lee... 'M' is another big one: Lilah Morgan, Lindsey McDonald, Holland
    Manners, Linwood Murrow, Marcus Hamilton...\r\n\r\nAnd have you noticed that David
    Boreanaz can't say Wolfram &amp; Hart? (It sounds more like Woofram &amp; Hart.)\r\n\r\nAnd
    I really could have gone my entire life without seeing Wesley do that thing with
    his tongue. Yeesh."

  content: Season 4 of Angel is my favorite, it really gets better as it goes along.
    John and I had a discussion this morning about Connor, and John decided that the
    story that Whedon is retelling with Connor is Mordred. Which seems completely
    obvious to me now that I've thought about it.

<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Deep Down"</strong> (Steven S. DeKnight)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1770" title="deep-down-angel" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-angel.jpg" alt="deep-down-angel"   /></p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of <em>Angel</em> but I am a completist* and I've started so I'll finish and so we are watching S4 to accompany <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> S7.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have decided to blog <em>Angel</em> from now on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1769" title="deep-down-lorne" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-lorne.jpg" alt="deep-down-lorne"   /></p>
<p>I am watching S4 with low expectations so it was a pleasant surprise how much I enjoyed this. It was really sad to see Andy Hallett resplendent in his greenery because it is terrible that he has died so ridiculously young. He also played one of my favourite characters. Cordy is also one of my favourites so it was disappointing to see so little of her (though storywise it made sense).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1768" title="deep-down-cordy" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-cordy.jpg" alt="deep-down-cordy"   /></p>
<p>Fred and Gunn are a tiresome couple. The Fluffy dialogue started off being amusing but degenerated into tastelessness and unfunniness. It was painful.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1772" title="deep-down-fred" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-fred.jpg" alt="Taking a Fluffy joke a little too far"   /></p>
<p>The sex scene between Wes and Lilah was notable for Alexis Denisof's chest, for Wesley doing something weird with his tongue and for Lilah licking his neck. The latter two things I wish I could forget.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1771" title="deep-down-lilah" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-lilah.jpg" alt="deep-down-lilah"   /></p>
<p>Stephanie Romanov looked rather lovely and her character has indisputably moved to the right of the dark side with her beheading of Linwood. Linwood had a point, mind you, about her shortcomings, she is generally useless particularly if she did think Wesley didn't know anything.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1767" title="deep-down-connor" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/deep-down-connor.jpg" alt="deep-down-connor"   /></p>
<p>I like Vincent Kartheiser as Connor. I like the actor so much in <em>Mad Men</em> that I may be predisposed to like Connor but then I do like Dawn too.</p>
<p>Angel's chat with Connor asking him what he deserved (a second chance, clearly) worked quite well considering the whole champion thing and using the comparison of what Buffy did to him (for more noble reasons, it must be said!) was excellent.</p>
<p>Since everything I write about seems to come back to <em>Dollhouse</em>, here is another observation. My problem with <em>DH</em> is that if you are going to deal with "difficult" subjects like prostitution, trafficking,&nbsp; etc, then you need to deal with it well. Dealing with it crappily isn't acceptable. So if <em>Angel</em> isn't that great, it really doesn't matter because it doesn't usually deal with difficult real-life issues. Which is why "Billy" is one of my least favourite episodes along with "I Fall to Pieces" (stalking), "Hero" (Nazis) and "Expecting" (forced surrogate pregnancy).</p>
<p>*I'll probably one day finish <em>Astonishing X-Men</em> and I won't stop watching <em>Dollhouse</em> if it's renewed just like I didn't stop watching <em>Heroes</em> at the end of S2. I have stopped now. The murder of Elle was the final straw for a show that has next to no idea of how to write female characters of any interest at all.</p>
