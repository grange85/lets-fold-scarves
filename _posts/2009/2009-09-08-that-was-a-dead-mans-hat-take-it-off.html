<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Arrangements"</strong> (Andrew Colville &amp; Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2302" title="Mad Men S03E04 - Sally at the door" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/Mad-Men-S03E04.jpg" alt="Mad Men S03E04 - Sally at the door" width="500" height="244" /></em></strong></p>
<p>This was a mixed bag of an episode because there was so much I disliked.</p>
<p>Betty and Don are the most dreadful parents. All Don had to do was open his arms and say &ldquo;come here, sweetpea, we are all upset and we are showing it in different ways&rdquo;. Instead the be-tutu&rsquo;d Sally went to lie in the living room watching gloomy stuff on TV and deeply resenting her parents.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that so many people (at Basket of Kisses and TWoP) don&rsquo;t realise (or accept) that Don is as bad as Betty as a parent. They detect warmth in him that is absent from her. However, the only warmth emanating from him is the warmth that ten hours absence a day brings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that Gene was a better grandfather than he was a father although maybe his attempts at bonding weren&rsquo;t that admirable (though they were lots of fun). Grandparents have more time to spend with their grandchildren because (usually) they are no longer working.</p>
<p>The sooner Betty has the baby the better. I am increasingly frustrated at how she is behaving. Hormones, self-centredness, fearfulness and the fact I can&rsquo;t see that her character has changed at all since the end of S2 makes Betty very unattractive at the moment.</p>
<p>There was lots of Peggy to enjoy like her willingness to take Joan&rsquo;s advice (that woman has so much potential) and her silent eloquence regarding the Patio Ann-Margret commercial but I hated that she wrote a great ad for someone else and is now flat-hunting with a totally unsuitable person. I hated this because it is stupid and unworthy of this show. It is rare for such a misfire to occur. I can usually swallow anything Matthew Weiner throws at me.</p>
<p>The jai alai storyline was moderately amusing mainly because it was nice to hear Pete being called Humps.</p>
<p>Sal&rsquo;s pyjamas show that only Pete can pull off the endearing dorky look. Bloody hell though that scene was awesome. Both Bryan Batt and, particularly, Sarah Drew as Kitty were fabulous. I can&rsquo;t be sure just what Kitty has realised but there was definitely a light bulb glowing above her head.</p>
