  content: I loathed that season of Angel.  The previous ones were watchable crud
    yet soemhow addictive, whereas the pregnant Cordy and Zoe as Goddess seasonw as
    utterly dire in every way.

  content: "Completely disagree with you, <b>Saranga</b>. I think season four
    of <i>Angel</i> is the most tightly written season of the series. \r\n\r\nThe
    good writing just hasn't gotten started quite yet...\r\n\r\nThis episode is bad.
    I don't like it. I think I've only watched it once, when it first aired. Obviously,
    the writers wanted to break up Fred and Gunn. Why they chose to do it this way
    I couldn't say. Joss has such a crush on Amy Acker/Fred that he couldn't have
    her do something so bad as to kill someone, so he inexplicably forced it onto
    Gunn. It's just crap storytelling."

  content: Erm, I pointed out that I am a virgin to <em>Angel</em> and, although
    I am spoiled on several points, I don't actually know how the series makes it
    way to those points so please, no more spoilers. Thanks.

  content: Oops. Wasn't intending for my post to be spoilery but I guess it kind of
    reads that way. Sorry. My thoughts above were the thoughts I had after I first
    watched the episode.

  content: Thanks. However, I do know how easy it is to inadvertently spoil someone.
    I did that to Andy by mentioning that Amber Benson didn't come back for S7 and
    so by that he knew there would be no Joyce/Jenny type appearances for Tara.

  content: Season 4 was seriously sickening.  The best things about it were the destruction
    of W&amp;H and the whole darkness/light arc... the cause of it being cordy
    and the whole Cordy/Connor thing made me sick to my stomach.  Yeuch.  I liked
    Angel better than Buffy up to that point.  Even though I enjoyed a lot of season
    5, all the females dying and the implied death of everyone at the end wasn't exactly
    a stellar ending though it was well written, they made choices that were indefensible.  Season
    4 though... just sickens me.  it's my least watched season. Its the reason I don't
    watch the whole series from beginning to end repeatedly like I've ended up doing
    with Buffy... I can't bear to watch season 4 of Ats.

<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Supersymmetry"</strong> (Elizabeth Craft &amp; Sarah Fain)</p>
<p>I sort of wish that I hadn&rsquo;t decided to blog about <em>Angel</em>. I dislike myself when I cannot find nice things to say about characters and actors and writers for episode after episode. Suffice to say that Fred, Gunn and Wesley and the actors who played them annoyed me as much as ever. I am also pissed off that the writers had Gunn kill the professor. I am at a loss to understand that. It makes Gunn such an unnecessarily dubious character while whitewashing Fred&rsquo;s blood lust. She started it so she should have finished it. Though I am aware that the story between these two isn&rsquo;t over and Gunn&rsquo;s action will have repercussions, it just seems to me that Gunn has been abruptly pushed in a new direction that I would never had expected. BTW, non-dedicated readers, I am blogging about <em>Angel</em> from a virgin point of view so, in theory, I have no idea what happens next. In theory&hellip;but try being unspoiled on the sites I frequent on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2055" title="Connor in Supersymmetry" src="/images/uploads/2009/06/super-connor.jpg" alt="Connor in Supersymmetry"   /></em></strong></p>
<p>I have inappropriate feelings towards Vincent Kartheiser. He&rsquo;s so young looking. It initially seemed plain wrong that he fancies Cordy despite the fact that on the show she is supposed to be about 21 or 22. I love how any mention of Cordy&rsquo;s youth has been dropped from <em>Angel</em> because Charisma always looked way too old to be a high-schooler on <em>Buffy</em>. Anyway, I think Vincent is endearing. And Charisma is looking pregnant and womanly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2056" title="Lilah in Supersymmetry" src="/images/uploads/2009/06/super-lilah.jpg" alt="Lilah in Supersymmetry"   /></p>
<p>I also think Lilah is endearing though in a completely different way. The writers were really naughty to have Lilah describe Fred as a twig. I was chuckling over that for far too long. I liked her scene with Angel in the car park. "Tragedy struck Gidget? Really? Did she go to that place in the big Texas sky?" "Yeah, yeah, hulk smash..."</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no scientist but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that it would be impossible for Fred to get published and a symposium gig no matter how hidden her work has supposed to have been on the show.</p>
<p>It was a throwaway line but it seemed daft to say that there are forums dedicated to Angel on the Internet. Almost as stupid as the current storyline in <em>Buffy</em> S8.</p>
<p>I quickly sussed out the professor was the bad guy but then I thought that was too obvious. Ah well.</p>
<p>And the least said about "You know what they say about payback? Well, I'm the bitch", the better.</p>
