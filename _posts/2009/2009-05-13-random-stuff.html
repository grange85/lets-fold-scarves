<p>I thought <a href="http://www.brianwood.com/">Brian Wood</a> and <a href="http://inkandthunder.blogspot.com/">Becky Cloonan</a>'s <a href="http://www.brianwood.com/demoproposal.html"><em>Demo</em></a> (2005) was a tremendous piece of work: certainly one of the best comics I have read in the last year. It seems that Becky is a pretty good writer too as this creepy MySpace Dark Horse Presents comic called<em> <a href="http://myspace.com/darkhorsepresents?issuenum=16&amp;storynum=4">I See The Devil in My Sleep</a></em> shows. Nathan looks like Alan Tudyk.</p>
<p>I'm listening to <em>Judy at Carnegie Hall</em> (1961) on <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/1wOJxQfE26bdp8ftnL83UM">Spotify</a> at the moment. I own this album on vinyl and so I haven't listened to it in years. It is really rather good. Garland's voice is still strong and the song selection is fabulous. She recounts a story about a newspaper article that describes her so: "She's not plump, she's not chubby, she's fat." - I guess the Daily Mail was around then too.</p>
<p>Talking of Spotify reminds me of <em>The Gadget Show </em>and Gail Porter's recent stint on the show while Suzi Perry was unwell. Gail and Jason did a comparison between Spotify and iTunes but that is besides my point which is that I can't tell you how fantastic it was to see a <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/uploads/media/GailPorter1_1.jpg">bald, large, unapologetic</a> woman fronting a TV show. I admire how Gail has dealt with her alopecia areata.</p>
<p>I thought this recent post over at Sociological Images about <a href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/04/15/who-is-facebook/">Facebook's neutral avatar</a> was really interesting. It is a man and so not neutral and goes in the face of Facebook's demographic. The leaflet that has just come through our door (only eight days after the day I thought we were supposed to get one) called <em>Important Information About Swine Flu</em> has two images of people: a man sneezing on the front cover and an avatar type image of a man inside. I don't think it would have occurred to me that there was something iffy about that before.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/05/04/default-avatars-a-collection/">follow up post</a> is interesting too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2009/05/say_what">Awesome!</a> Feminists have just been told by a feminist to lighten up. Her exact words are "Chill out everyone, it was a bit of fun!". <a href="http://viv.id.au/blog/20070414.431/anti-feminist-bingo-a-master-class-in-sexual-entitlement/">Bingo!</a> Julie, get lost.</p>
