<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Love Among the Ruins" </strong>(Cathryn Humphris &amp; Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2255" title="Mad Men s02e02 - peggy" src="/images/uploads/2009/08/Mad-Men-s02e02-peggy.jpg" alt="Mad Men s02e02 - peggy"   /></p>
<p>For once, I couldn't care less about Betty's storyline. As far as I can tell the Draper domestic scenes were put together for one reason and that was to get Betty's dad into their home. Betty's antagonism towards William's wife was inexplicable; Don's bossing of William was weird; did pregnant Betty really want a vulnerable person in her house weeks before the arrival of a new baby?; should Don have clarified that with her?</p>
<p>Did children in 1963 constantly watch TV? Or did the children leap in front of the TV just before dad came home?</p>
<p>One other scene didn't seem right to me (although I enjoyed it just because I love VK as Pete) involved Paul's outburst to the Madison Square Garden people. It was startlingly inappropriate and unprofessional. Folk have been fired for less.</p>
<p>However, overall I much preferred this to the first episode and I can put that squarely at the feet of Peggy and Roger. Now, I <em>can't stand</em> Roger so I enjoyed Betty's offhandedness towards him; the look between him and Joan; and the scene between his daughter, ex-wife and future son-in-law where it's clear that nobody likes him; these moments  cheered me up no end. I also like that John Slattery and Talia Balsam are married to each other and get to pretend to be estranged. For some reason that amuses me.</p>
<p>On to the character that I like. This was Peggy's episode and Elisabeth Moss has totally won me over to her portrayal. The <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2009/08/27/peggy-is-working-it-out/">reaction</a> to her one night stand is interesting. Do the male characters have their self-esteem issues critiqued in quite the same way? I don't think it will have had a negative effect on her self-esteem or boosted it tremendously but she will have found it a useful experience. She slept with the young man on her own terms and she proved to herself that she was not unattractive and could pick up a man if she wanted too.&nbsp; All I hope is that whatever the two of them got up to involved reciprocation.</p>
<p>Peggy singing "Bye Bye Birdie" into the mirror was a highlight.</p>
