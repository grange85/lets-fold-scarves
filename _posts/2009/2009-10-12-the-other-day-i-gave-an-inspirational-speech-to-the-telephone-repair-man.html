  content: I know, this is an old post, but I was reading it for some research for
    my English essay... Just thought you should know it was Willow, not Angel who
    talked about her vamp twin in "Doppelgangland".....

  content: "Hi Bri, \n\nThanks for commenting, old post or not! \n\nI know that Willow
    makes the \"kinda gay\" statement but after she does Angel starts to contradict
    Buffy's remark that a vamp's personality has nothing to do with the original person's.
    <em>However</em>, if I had written that paragraph a little more clearly then
    you wouldn't have misunderstood me!"

<p><strong>Lie My Parents Told Me</strong> (David Fury and Drew Goddard)</p>

<p>I don't care enough about Spike to get over involved in this episode. Anya nails it when she says "Spike's got some sort of "Get Out      of Jail Free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us." However, I also find that sort of meta-commentary a little too conceited for my liking.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2452" title="Lies My Parents Told Me - Anya in a silly hat" src="/images/uploads/2009/10/LMPTM-Anya.jpg" alt="Lies My Parents Told Me - Anya in a silly hat" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>By the way, Buffy, Spike can be triggered at any time and you have unequivocal proof but just let him go because people with souls are never ever bad. It will be okay.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that they decided to have Robin beating up Spike rather than getting on with it because that's just irritating.</p>
<p>Spike tells Robin that Nikki didn't love him but his own mother did. The nasty things she said were because he had set loose a demon and it wasn't his mother speaking. However, Angel hinted more than a little strongly in "Doppelgangland" that the vampire personality wasn't entirely divorced from the human self ("That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and...skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay." - oh happy days).</p>
<p>Giles also pontificates to Buffy that being a general requires her to make difficult decisions but, when she does make those difficult decisions in "Dirty Girls", he's protesting. Make up your mind, Mr Betrayer, generals don't often have subordinates questioning them.</p>
<p>"Spike is the strongest warrior we have." - no, Buffy, you are.</p>
