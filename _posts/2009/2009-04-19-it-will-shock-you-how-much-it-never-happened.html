<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The New Girl"</strong> (Robin Veith)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1747" title="Mad Men - The New Girl - Peggy and Bobbie" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/mad-men-25.jpg" alt="Mad Men - The New Girl - Peggy and Bobbie"   /></p>
<ul>
<li>Bobbie was bearable which I attribute to the character being portrayed as less sexual predator and more rounded person</li>
<li>Melinda McGraw who plays Bobbie has a resemblance to noughties Madonna</li>
<li>I was confused by the timeline because I assumed that Bobbie was just staying with Peggy for the day and not until her black eye diminished</li>
<li>Peggy's flashbacks were welcome particularly since they ultimately led to my favourite moment of S2 so far when Peggy called Don "Don"</li>
<li>Betty's "because we love him" answer to Sally's question about Don's salt intake was really poignant</li>
<li>Pete is just about a <strong>complete</strong> ass: hee-hawing about his viable sperm and just completely forgetting about his wife's feelings</li>
<li>he redeemed himself by not storming out but stopping himself to actually listen to Trudy</li>
<li>I'm not sure what to make of Don's new secretary but I do miss sweet, kind useless Lois</li>
<li>I was most pleased to see Rachel because it closes a door in Don's life</li>
<li>I do wish her husband was as good-looking as Don because I don't want to think of her as settling for second best via pop culture's shorthand that ordinary looking people are mundane individuals (hello, Susan Boyle)</li><br />
</ul></p>
