  content: "<i>Are all American butcher shops like that? Super busy and with a ticketing
    system?</i>\r\n\r\nThe one that I go to certainly is ... but then, it's in
    a major metropolitan area and so popular that it draws people from all over the
    region. I doubt that a butcher shop in a small town like Sunnydale would draw
    that much business. But then again, Sunnydale has a major state university, at
    least one other college, a zoo, a major shopping mall, and a few other things
    you wouldn't expect in a typical American town of 30,000 with a struggling real
    estate market. \r\n\r\n<i>What the hell was that with Principal Wood and Jonathan&rsquo;s
    body?</i>\r\n\r\nI don't know, and I don't recall it ever being explained."

  content: "The butcher shop I frequented as a kid with my parents did not have a
    number system, but it was fairly busy. These days though butcher shops that are
    just butcher shops are hard to find. Most people use the meat section of their
    supermarket instead of a specialized store. At least out here in the suburbs anyway.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Principal Wood and Jonathan's body, I just figured he was \"taking care of
    it\" and burying it quietly before someone else found it and the police were called.
    \r\n\r\nAs for women hitting men, it really depends on the context, which I can
    say for men hitting women as well. If it's a fight scene, then I think it's fair
    game. But if it's pointless violence or, like here, violence intended to be humorous,
    I cringe whether it's women hitting men, men hitting women, men hitting men or
    women hitting women. Violence is never funny to me."

<p><strong>Never Leave Me</strong> (Drew Goddard)</p>
<p>Andrew can't help himself by mentioning Patrick Swayze. Tom Lenk is excellent as Andrew, by the way. It's a pity that Andrew is a character I have little time for. Or that I think I have little time for although time will tell if I revise that opinion.</p>
<p>Tying a super strong vampire to a chair was always a good idea, I don't think.</p>
<p>Are all American butcher shops like that? Super busy and with a ticketing system?</p>
<p>I love that Andrew is terrified of Willow and how she plays up to that. It's a nice contrast with Willow's attempt at being mean in "Doppelgangland". This Willow knows how to be scary but still adds an "ok?"</p>

<p>I have reached a stage where I plain cringe when women hit men (because, obviously, I already cringe when men hit women!) and so I didn't enjoy Xander and Anya's good cop, bad cop routine.</p>
<p>Spike in shackles. The imagery is complete.</p>

<p>Eye roll: "You like men who hurt you". Buffy denies this, thank goodness.</p>
<p>What the hell was that with Principal Wood and Jonathan's body?</p>
<p>Duh, duh, duh, Buffy has sussed it; it's the First.</p>
<p>I know <em>Buffy</em> is low budget but that Watchers' Council explosion is pretty awful stuff.</p>
