  content: "I remember how totally weird to was to see Sarah Hagan as Amanda in this
    episode and not in 'Freaks &amp; Geeks'. Oh, Millie. \r\n\r\nI guess it's pretty
    obv by this point that I'm a big WT shipper. That scene at the graveyard gets
    me every time. So little, says so much."

  content: "\"I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and
    tricky.\"\r\n\r\nI like the way Nick Brendon delivers that line.\r\n\r\nI have
    a fondness for this episode that I probably wouldn't otherwise if not for Azure
    Skye and Sarah Hagan. I really like Skye as Cassie and I was bummed that she had
    to die at the end of the episode, though I do like how that plot twist played
    out. As for Sarah Hagan, well, Millie! I never remember her character's name because
    she's just Millie to me. She's great here with her bit about beating up a boy.\r\n\r\nI
    also think the scene of Willow visiting Tara's grave is well done (I like that
    Willow puts a rock on the headstone), but it's frustrating that it seems like
    they can't say Tara's name."

<p><strong>Help</strong> (Rebecca Rand Kirshner)</p>
<p>Season 7 is now 3 for 4 which isn&rsquo;t bad, I suppose. This strongly reminded me of &ldquo;Reptile Boy&rdquo; from way, way back. However, it was better than &ldquo;Reptile Boy&rdquo; even if it was relatively predictable until Cassie&rsquo;s death which was totally unexpected and yet satisfying. Buffy cannot help everybody. Actually, that theme may have been touched upon before. Maybe in S5. Oh, anyway, I enjoyed this rehash of old stories and themes with added Amanda (&ldquo;and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face right into the pavement&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Obviously there is still that elephant in the room. Maybe Xander might have mentioned Tara to Willow as they were walking to her grave? Maybe.</p>

<p>Buffy knows an awful lot about the Foreign Legion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/google.asp">Googled</a> her yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, all I'm saying is that this is normal teen stuff. You join chat rooms, you write poetry, you post Doogie Howser fan-fic. It's all normal, right?&rdquo; &ndash; who knew Alyson and Neil would be together in a <em>Friends</em> type environment?</p>

<p>When is Cassie&rsquo;s dad going to sue Sunnydale High, Buffy&rsquo;s employer?</p>
<p>We lasted such a long time without Spike in this episode. No Anya at all.</p>
<p>I love it when Buffy catches the bolt (that is some booby trap) and then Cassie dies.</p>
