<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Long Day's Journey" </strong>(<a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Mere_Smith">Mere Smith</a>)</p>

<p>I loved Manny. He was really funny and by no means a caricature.</p>
<p>Gwen and her horrible tops are back. What were the set designers thinking of when they made her pad so totally unlikely for a young woman who wears horrible tops like that? It&rsquo;s like they had a spare set left over for a Wolfram &amp; Hart board member and decided to be frugal and reuse it.</p>
<p>I was totally convinced that Cordelia was responsible for everything so it really surprised me that it was Angel(us).</p>
<p>This was a straightforward episode which passed the time but didn't inspire any awe-inspiring thoughts in me.</p>
