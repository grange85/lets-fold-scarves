  content: "When Echo got hit by the mallet but didn't show any bruises (why does
    no one show bruises on this show?  or Buffy?), I thought \"well, it's because
    she's Faith the Slayer and slayers don't show bruises.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yes, Enver
    Gjokaj is about the best actor on this show.\r\n\r\nStill watching, though it's
    not appointment TV."

  content: "well, possibly;\r\n\r\n1. Rossum is in bed with Academia and vice versa,
    we know this already. The lecturer fiscal income is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n2. It was
    a test of Ballard by Adelle.\r\n\r\n3. There's a spy in the dollhouse still remember?
    \r\n\r\n4. Down to the network not the show.\r\n\r\n5. echo did that on purpose,
    the way she spoke and everything was 'self aware' ala Epitaph 1.\r\n\r\n6. Was
    just a cheesy shout out to Silence of the Lambs.\r\n\r\n7. Told us more about
    Ballard than it did about the gender issues.\r\n\r\ni think the show has really
    picked up since it started last year and i liked this episode a lot. i notice
    you (apparently) confuse Whedon with Minear a bit and it's Tim's episodes on Angel
    and Dollhouse that you seem to especially dislike, which is fair enough but maybe
    the 'Whedon-double' issue is actually a Joss and Tim issue."

  content: "Actually I had forgotten there was still a spy but I would like to bet
    5p that that issue isn't resolved. \n\nThe slow motion tells us more about the
    programme makers than Ballard. \n\nNice try regarding the lecturer though quite
    why Rossum would be interested in helping out a Middle English professor (and
    his university) is beyond me. I prefer the idea that he is a best-selling author
    (maybe he&rsquo;s a Dan Brown) who can&rsquo;t tear himself away from teaching.
    Either way, I did enjoy Arye Gross in <em>Ellen</em>.\n\nActually, I&rsquo;m
    not confused with Minear and Whedon. I do pay attention to who writes (or is credited
    with) an episode. Though if you mean that I have a tendency to not like Minear&rsquo;s
    work compared with Whedon&rsquo;s you are right (but, of last season&rsquo;s first
    five, I enjoyed &ldquo;True Believer&rdquo; the most). And you definitely have
    a point regarding that I may have an issue with them working together because
    I think <em>Firefly</em>'s &ldquo;The Message&rdquo; was one of the worst
    things in the Whedonverse and they wrote it together."

    than i intended, i was indeed thinking of your views on The Message etc.\r\n\r\nthank
    you for the reply - i very much appreciate that you do so... i often find we disagree
    so it's nice that you respond. \r\n\r\nyou do make me think about a lot of issues
    and opinions that i would probably miss otherwise - and i appreciate that too!\r\n\r\nwow,
    flattery much? i must be in a good mood LOL!"

  content: "Dollhouse has been canceled. After January, the show won't be around anymore
    for you to complain about. On the bright side, this will no doubt allow Joss and
    company to make the Doctor Horrible sequel sooner, rather than later. Unless of
    course, you have some sort of issue with that one as well. \r\n\r\nIf so, perhaps
    it would be wise to just steer clear of Whedon's material altogether from now
    on. It seems to me, your negatives about his work are more abundant than his positives.
    I could be completely wrong. I'll keep digging here and get back to you. Nevertheless,
    your blog is always entertaining and interesting to read, even if I find myself
    disagreeing and shaking my head more often than not. Keep writing. Love the humor.

  content: "Dear John, \n\nThanks for stopping by and for the nice things you said
    about my blog.\n\n I am clearly in a unhealthy relationship with the work of Joss
    Whedon. I love the vast majority of <em>Buffy</em> and three episodes of <em>Firefly</em>
    are probably three of my favourite episodes of anything. <em>Serenity</em>
    is one of my favourite films.  However, when it comes to <em>Angel</em> and
    <em>Dollhouse</em>, I want to love but can't and, despite how bad I think
    they are at times, I keep watching.\n\nAs you may have noted I have stopped blogging
    about <em>Dollhouse</em> (and <em>Angel</em>) because in the words of
    Anya, \"God, I hate this. This tone in my voice? I dislike it more than you do,
    and I'm closer to it!\" Ironically, \"Belonging\" was a great episode, not without
    flaws, but utterly compelling and superbly acted so maybe I stopped too soon.\n\nI
    am sad that <em>Dollhouse</em> has been axed because lots of people will need
    to find new jobs now but, on the other hand, I can't wait to see Enver Gjokaj
    become a star.\n \nAs to <em>Dr Horrible</em>, I have a cat called Penny (as
    well as two others called Wash and Tara) so..."

<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Belle Chose"</strong> (Tim Minear)</p>
<p>Tim Minear brings his ludicrous serial killers over from <em>The Inside</em> and decides that subtlety or indeed, coherence aren't needed.</p>
<p>Make of what you will from this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>a college professor can afford to hire a doll</li>
<li>Ballard is given the job of interrogating Terry/Victor because he used to work for the FBI but, as we have seen before, the Dollhouse usually prefers the perfection of imprinting one</li>
<li>Brad and Terry/Victor escape easily</li>
<li> the usual lack of physical consequences when someone is thwacked with a croquet mallet</li>
<li>Echo doesn't have her towel hooked up in the shower just so Paul could look uncomfortable at seeing her naked</li>
<li>there is slow motion of Kiki/Echo looking at herself in the mirror</li>
<li>having gender non-specific names makes you a perve</li><br />
</ul><br />
I am looking forward to the day when I can say I knew that Enver Gjokaj was going to a star when I saw his range, assurance, and general awesomeness in <em>Dollhouse</em>.</p>
<p>Olivia Williams as Adelle is the only thing that I positively like about <em>Dollhouse</em>*. I like Enver as an actor but he is playing many roles so it's hard to like the combination.</p>
<p>The issues that this show is tackling bother me. Exploring misogyny is too near to celebrating it for my liking. Isn't it hilarious when a man behaves like a woman? <a href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/shoogle">Shoogling</a> his bum like that - it's so silly and funny.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, I don't watch much that deals with serial killers or child abusers or prostitution or arms dealers or, you get the idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2009/10/03/every-time-they-make-it-so-real/#comment-941">Like Charles</a>, I find myself wondering "if Buffy and Firefly were the exception and that in actuality the real Joss is the one responsible for Angel and Dollhouse."</p>
<p>I am not going to systematically write about <em>Dollhouse</em> anymore. I know for a fact that if this wasn't a Joss Whedon show, I would definitely not be watching any more of it. I need to get a grip and just stop watching.</p>
<p>*Adelle may even be one of my<a href="http://www.scifi.co.uk/blog/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/top-five-joss-whedon-character/"> top five Whedon characters</a>.</p>
