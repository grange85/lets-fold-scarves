<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "Maidenform"</strong> (Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p><strong><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1755" title="Mad Men - Maidenform - Don leaves Bobbie tied up" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/mad-men-maidenform.jpg" alt="Mad Men - Maidenform - Don leaves Bobbie tied up" width="426" height="300" /></em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I watch <em>Mad Men</em> and wonder what the hell the characters are doing and why.</p>
<p>This should have been a brilliant episode but it seemed to miss the mark for me too many times.</p>
<p>Four examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>I simply don't believe that an unaccompanied woman would be allowed in a strip club in the early sixties.</li>
<li>Would Betty really wander around serving breakfast to her children in a bikini? (No matter how hot a month of May it was.)</li>
<li>This may be a trivial example but while it was shocking that a person could dump his dog outside to fend for itself while he goes off to drink (or commit suicide or not to drink, I dunno) it lost its sadness when the dog turned away and, after spotting his off-screen handler, trotted off tail wagging.</li>
<li>The use of a modern song at the beginning was jarring and <em>wrong</em>. After 18 episodes of perfectly chosen music this was extra-specially wrong even if the lyrics were appropriate.</li><br />
</ol><br />
The irony of excluding the people who actually wear Playtex (and probably buy most of it) was sad. I thought Peggy was excessively passive throughout which made her transformation seem even sillier. Just who is she going to listen to next?</p>
<p>Poor Pete. He has absolutely no idea what an arse he is. He tries so hard to chat amiably with Peggy but is rebuffed. He makes friends with a girl dog who's a boy dog. He then shags a model (who failed to get the part) in the living room of her apartment with her mother next door. His self awareness is pitiful. He actually thinks he isn't a loser.</p>
<p>Fucking Don - take that in all its meanings - he is such a horrible character at the moment. I'm glad he took a moment to think at the end. He needs to get a grip and soon. He has all he needs at home if he would just look.</p>
<p>I'm itching for Betty to tell Don where to shove his patronising hypocritical attitude. I suspect I have a long wait.</p>
<p>I guess we have seen the last of Bobbie unless her next appearance is to take some sort of well deserved revenge on Don. I don't like the character at all but Melinda McGraw plays her brilliantly.</p>
<p>The Jackie/Marilyn/Madonna/whore thing was interesting and I have no doubt the assvertising industry would love to have two such strong models to divide modern women into such day and night categories. I see Peggy as a Joanne Woodward.</p>
<p>I'm not the brightest of people so I didn't get that Don was a bit of a Jackie/Marilyn/Madonna/whore himself and missed the symbolism of the mirror at the end but I really don't understand how people could query his discomfort at being celebrated as a hero on Memorial Day.</p>
