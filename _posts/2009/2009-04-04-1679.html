  content: Yes. Buffy's hair is nice. When she knows that Willow is trying to find
    Warren AND KILL HIM she takes extra time with that curling iron. Good priorities
    there, Slayer.

  content: "Actually, we watched it over two weeks when it first aired. UPN ran <i>Two
    to Go</i> and <i>Grave</i> together on the initial broadcast. \r\n\r\nIt
    was still too long. \r\n\r\n(And they really should have run <i>Villains</i>
    and <i>Two to Go</i> so the cliffhanger ended on Giles' return.) \r\n\r\nI
    hated the episode when it first ran, and my opinion hasn't improved since then."

  content: It was definitely too long. Two episodes would have sufficed to cut out
    all the filler and the embarrassingly poor bits.

<p><strong>Villains</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>The ending of this is vile. Truly Willow is Dark. Cold blooded murder. Nasty.</p>
<p>Coolest scene: Willow absorbing the dark magic and going dark. A chilling and memorable moment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1684" title="villians-willow" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-willow.jpg" alt="villians-willow" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>Poor Dawn. The only emotional part of this episode is her sitting in the dark, shocked &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687" title="villians-dawn" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-dawn.jpg" alt="villians-dawn" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also put Xander and Buffy&rsquo;s muted reaction to the news of Tara&rsquo;s death down to shock. At least Buffy looks concerned and I&rsquo;m sure there is plenty of time to pay proper tribute to her. OK, I&rsquo;ll stop snarking and think positively.</p>
<p>The conversation between Buffy, Xander and Dawn is heavy handed but otherwise this episode is good. Willow&rsquo;s reaction is in character. Vampire Willow was a sadistic, cruel piece of work.</p>
<p>Why can't Dawn go with Buffy? It is so bloody boring that she has got to kept safe all the bleeding time. And her sister's the Slayer: teach her self defence, Buffy. And, this really bugs me. I know that Buffy is depressed and that's one of the reasons she works in a burger bar but why couldn't she have become a fitness instructor or someone who works in a gym?</p>
<p>Spike in &ldquo;Africa&rdquo; was tedious and I hate being mislead by his use of &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s okay for Warren to use it because I think he might be a misogynist. Not sure though, it&rsquo;s kinda subtle.</p>
<p>My word, Adam Busch is a hairy chap. I hope Amber got paid the full amount for this episode even though she did spend a lot of time lying on the floor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s dead and only two to go except they renege on that promise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686" title="villians-warren" src="/images/uploads/2009/04/villians-warren.jpg" alt="villians-warren" width="535" height="300" /></p>
<p>I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been to watch S6 in real time and for it to wind up over three episodes and three weeks. It&rsquo;s too long.</p>
<p>Buffy's hair was very nice.</p>
