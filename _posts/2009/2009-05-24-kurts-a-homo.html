<p><strong><em>Mad Men</em> - "The Jet Set" </strong>(Matthew Weiner)</p>
<p>I think I get Matthew Weiner&rsquo;s intentions for &ldquo;The Jet Set&rdquo; but I felt a growing sense of disbelief as the episode progressed. It just didn&rsquo;t work at all. The bohemians felt so phoney that it took me ages to realise that they weren&rsquo;t actually con artists or something of that ilk (or maybe they were - sometimes I think I watch through a fog of incomprehension). The actor playing Willy was the least convincing and Joy with Don felt forced and unnatural.</p>
<p>I may be misinterpreting this but I felt they were also trying to present Pete as an awkward and somewhat repellent figure. He may be a bit of an idiot (<em>maybe</em>) but he&rsquo;s not so instantly dislikeable and certainly has not been depicted in that way before.</p>
<p>All the focus on Don and his failure to connect to people who have cracked glasses poolside meant no Betty time and I did want to see how she was getting on while he was away.</p>
<p>I loved Kurt&rsquo;s coming out which certainly didn&rsquo;t seem implausible to me. Not everyone was terrified of upsetting conventions and he is (pointing to Scandinavia maybe) European&hellip; I am disappointed his makeover of Peggy didn&rsquo;t do something with her fringe but everything involving Kurt and Peggy made me laugh. She also wore two lovely outfits: a cream dress with red flowers and a green and black suit.</p>
