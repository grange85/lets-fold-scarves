    not sure I like knowing so much about how things are going to end up."

    Surely not!

    I have seen "Epitaph One" and I'm not sure why I didn't review it. I'll get to it soon.

<p><strong>Potential</strong> (Rebecca Rand Kirshner)</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2282" title="potential - buffy with arms crossed" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/potential-buffy.jpg" alt="And as for those trousers"   /></p>
<p>This follow up to "Showtime" was also pretty poor with more tedious speeches by Buffy. Maybe it's SMG's choice but her arm crossing to connote stern seriousness is becoming parodic.</p>
<p>Andrew's dialogue is getting repetitive with a variation of his "now I'm good" speech from "Bring on the Night" turning up here.</p>
<p>The First is in "remission"? And the town is still "lousy with Bringers"? Oh dear.</p>
<p>Andy noted that Molly's English accent is now becoming a highlight of each episode which is sadly true.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2009/08/23/sorry-to-barge-in-we-have-a-slight-apocalypse/comment-page-1/#comment-894"><strong>Georgia</strong></a>'s comment that the potentials are "like a powerful new addition to the mythology" is a fair one if that is what I wanted to see in the show. However, I want the Scoobies not the newbies. And not one of them looks fifteen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2283" title="potential - dawn" src="/images/uploads/2009/09/potential-dawn.jpg" alt="potential - dawn"   /></p>
<p>Dawn was in danger of getting an interesting storyline. Although I don't think I would have wanted her to be a potential slayer, she desperately needed a stronger purpose on the show. Even in the comics she still isn't that interesting.</p>

<p>Since Xander is my least favourite Scooby: he bugs me a lot of the time particularly when he gets all judgey towards the others. However, his speech about being not being special but extraordinary is rather lovely.</p>
<p>I don't really understand why Willow is <em>frequently</em> not allowed to do magic without <em>great</em> consequences occurring&nbsp; (i.e. black eyes) <em>whereas</em> if it suits the plot she <em>is</em> allowed to do locator spells.</p>
