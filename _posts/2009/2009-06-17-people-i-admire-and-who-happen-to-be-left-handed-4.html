<p><strong>Emma Thompson</strong></p>
<p>Emma Thompson has been part of my life for over twenty years. In fact, the Thompson family has been part of my life since the day I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Roundabout#English-language_version"><em>The Magic Roundabout</em> </a>on TV. Not only is she an excellent actress and a great presence but she is also an excellent person. I was going to write a lot of stuff on just why she's a top person but I thought this list would say it better:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.actionaid.org.uk/100795/a_message_from_our_chair_emma_thompson.html">Action Aid ambassador</a></li>
<li>her work against sex trafficking for the <a href="http://www.helenbamber.org/AboutJourney.html">Helen Bamber Foundation</a> - I won't directly link to the video <em>I am Elena</em> because it really upset me</li>
<li>her <a href="http://womenandaids.unaids.org/about/about_3.html">support</a> for the Global Coalition on Women and AIDS</li>
<li>her support for <a href="http://www.als.org.uk/subpages/08word.htm">Alone in London</a></li>
<li>her willingness to portray herself as a lesbian and an Ohioan in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1chq09Rn0Pg"><em>Ellen</em></a></li>
<li>her support for <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1540471,00.html">actresses</a> and <a href="http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,704,brit-actress-saved-by-outraged-emma,18324">eating</a></li>
<li>naming her daughter Gaia</li>
<li>she usually sports a short hair style</li>
<li>writing the best big screen adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em></li>
<li>being in two of my favourite TV series from the 80s, <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/789683/index.html"><em>Tutti Frutti</em></a> and <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1071284/index.html"><em>Fortunes of War</em></a></li>
<li>being absolutely the only redeeming thing in <em>Love, Actually</em></li><br />
</ul><br />
