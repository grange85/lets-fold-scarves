  content: "Thanks for commenting on my randomness, Jennifer.\r\n\r\nI really admire
    what you and the others do over at The Hathor Legacy. I was surprised how much
    I disagreed with your take on S1 of <i>Mad Men</i> because that's not usually
    the case.\r\n\r\nI've corrected the line referring to you above."

<p>Now that I am as up-to-date with <em>Mad Men</em> as anyone except Matthew Weiner, I can read <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/">Basket of Kisses</a> with gay abandon. It really is a super fansite with great interviews. For example, there is <a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2008/12/01/exclusive-interview-with-elisabeth-moss-thats-not-our-show/">this insightful one</a> with Elisabeth Moss who I was pleased to read did not play her scenes with Father Gill as if she found him attractive.&nbsp; There is tons of stuff I still haven&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p>Ages ago I noticed in my Google Reader a <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/the-misogyny-in-mad-men-is-ironic-all-right/">post</a> at The Hathor Legacy with the eye-catching line &ldquo;Betty really was just a hysterical housewife who needed to get laid&rdquo;. I immediately thought this was a S2 spoiler and quickly skipped the entry and mentally filed it for reading once I had finished S2. Many months later, I was most surprised to find that was what Jennifer Kesler <s>&rsquo;s reaction to the conclusion</s> felt was the message the show was sending at the end of  S1. <a href="http://everydaygoddess.typepad.com/">lizriz</a>&rsquo;s responses are close to my opinion and I never once thought that Peggy was stupid for not realising she was pregnant.</p>
<p>As a feminist my feelings about the show are mixed though I do think it has done a great job most of the time. Only occasionally I felt it has &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; its portrayal of sexism a little too much with lingering shots of Joan&rsquo;s ample bottom as she bends over and the sleazy remarks by the ad men in &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; as they watch a lipstick testing through a two way mirror. I am also aware that this is a minute slice of life. This a view of the 60s focused on a narrow privileged closed world that the majority of Americans never lived through.</p>
<p>I could get addicted to <em>Mad Men</em>. I wonder if there is any fan fiction? <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/tv/Mad_Men/ ">Duh</a>. (NB: I have not read any of them.)</p>
<p>I read about specialised crushes over at <a href="http://theantiroom.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/movie-and-tv-men-illusion-versus-reality/">The Anti-Room</a> and I can only agree with the examples of Viggo Mortensen and Jon Hamm. VM as Aragorn is a honeypie while JH with &ldquo;floppy hair and stubble&rdquo; is just not the same!</p>
<p>January Jones is in the specialised category too. As Betty she looks fantastic but, as herself now, in any photoshoot she looks generic starlet and doesn&rsquo;t look beautiful at all.</p>

<p>Despite what this says, <a href="http://madmenmad.wordpress.com/2008/04/11/amc-you-do-not-get-points-for-this/">this is not an extra scene but was shown in the original broadcast</a>. It has been cut from subsequent showings and it was definitely not on the BBC broadcast. I <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/12/25/this-device-isnt-a-spaceship-its-a-time-machine/">remember noting</a> that I had read the TWop recap that mentioned this scene. I thought then that it was just the BBC version that was cut but that seems not. And Pete <em>was</em> in his pajamas! Are the DVDs complete? I shall soon find out (once we have got through <em>Buffy</em> and <em>Angel</em>).</p>
