<p>In "The Attic" episode of <em>Dollhouse</em>, there were cans of London Pride (brewed a few miles from my part of London) on the shelves in Clyde's hideout.</p>

<p>In addition, there were also cans of Irn Bru and Tizer, a packet of digestives and a bottle of Dettol on the shelves.</p>

Someone enjoyed dressing that set.</p>
