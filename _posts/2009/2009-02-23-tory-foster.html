  content: "I've fallen behind on the new episodes, but word from a season 4.0 perspective.
    I think they chose to make her a cylon because of her proximity to the president,
    which would make her seem <i>GASP!</i> a threat. But she wasn't a very interesting
    character nor had much of a storyline before she was a cylon so I couldn't imagine
    her being a very interesting cylon. \r\n\r\nAt the point that they revealed the
    four cylons in the fleet, they really should have selected characters whose new-found
    cylon... Er, cylon-ness cast their past in an interesting new light. Tigh, Tyrol,
    and Anders fit that bill pretty well, but not Tory. (Note that three of the four
    have 'T' names. Coincidence?) And her sleeping with Anders and Baltar didn't serve
    to make me interested in a character who was fine when she was just a supporting
    minor character. But I think she was sacrificed on the altar of making one of
    the familiar final five \"evil,\" feeling as though her being a cylon made her
    better than the humans she had lived with in ignorance all her life. And she's
    a woman of color. Way to go, Moore."

<p>Regarding <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, what adequate explanation can there be that Tory Foster, one of the five final cylons, is the only one not to have an interesting storyline in season four? Scratch that - not to have a storyline at all. She offed Cally and she has now spent the last few episodes doing nothing in particular except to utter the line "I wanted to ask him about that frakking song."</p>
