  content: "Personally, I found this episode tremendously unsatisfying as an episode,
    a season finale, a series finale, or by any other measure I could think of. For
    me, it failed on all fronts. \r\n\r\nThe \"Spike's death\" fake-out had no resonance
    for me because by the time the episode aired, WB was already promoting Spike joining
    the cast of Angel. So it was just a summer death, and everyone who'd been paying
    attention to WB promos already knew it. In any case, the death lacked dramatic
    impact because it was so random: \"Here, Spike, wear this amulet that might do
    something sometime and, oh, look, a completely unexpected deus ex machina that
    turns you into living sunlight at just the right moment to bail us out after my
    tactically idiotic plan very predictably fails, and then it inexplicably craters
    Sunnydale. Whaddaya know?\" I had similar problems with the Slayer empowerment
    deus ex machina, and the Angel delivering a random magic device from another show
    (which itself was handed to him by Wolfram and Hart), and the Scythe just being
    dropped in their laps ... I can't even tell if Buffy won any kind of victory here,
    and if she did, she certainly didn't earn it.\r\n\r\nYour point about empowering
    all the Slayers in the world without so much as a \"by your leave\" was spot-on.
    Sure, Buffy said \"here's the part where you make a choice,\" and those who weren't
    there didn't get to choose ... but really, neither did those who WERE there. They
    could chose to join Operation Mass Suicide In The Hellmouth or get out of town,
    but getting Slayer-charged was an all-or-nothing deal. Dissenters couldn't bow
    out from being turned into superpowered demon magnets.\r\n\r\nJoss couldn't have
    a happy ending while killing a major character. Anya's death eliminated any chance
    of a \"happy ending\" for Anya fans. Plus, the way it was done was completely
    disrespectful to the characters and (IMO) the viewers -- Anya got the crappiest
    death scene of any major Joss character, ever, and besides, it was a death that
    didn't make sense. Why were Anya and Andrew even IN that fight? \"Anya, we're
    expecting some ubervamps to get through because we didn't station anyone at the
    entrance to the Hellmouth. You and Andrew don't know how to fight, so both of
    you just stand here with swords so they can kill you when we let them out.\"\r\n\r\nPlotting
    has never been Joss's strong suit, but here his utter disregard for even basic
    story logic left me feeling empty, totally disappointed, glad that this series
    was finally over, and wishing it had ended a couple seasons earlier."

    It is true she wanted to be killed off but <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22459" rel="nofollow">here are the words of Emma herself</a> when asked if she was "mad when her character was killed":
    <blockquote>No, I asked [Buffy creator Joss Whedon] to kill me, so there was no problem there," said Caulfield, "I wasn't expecting him to kill me in a&hellip;um&hellip;scene, I thought I'd get, I dunno, a little bit more love. No, but I wanted to die, I thought it would be poetic.</blockquote>

    I thought she'd get a little more love too.

  content: "I keep trying to write down my interpretation of the use of the word \"choice\"
    but it doesn't seem to work as well as I'd like. I'll have one last shot. \r\n\r\nTo
    me the choice isn't about being super-powered or not, it's about being in control
    of yourself. You potentials (and every other woman/girl?) no longer rely on
    anyone else to define your destiny - the choice is \"be who you want when you
    want\". I know that doesn't <em>quite</em> marry up with the montage during
    the empowerment but it makes more sense to me that way. I have problems a-plenty
    with the finish of S7 but I'm not so bothered by \"the choice.\""

    choice to use it at the nurture.\r\n\r\nIt is addressed in Season 8 where we see
    rogue slayers as well as the slayers who fight the good fight with Buffy.\r\n\r\nI
    still get verklempt just talking about the scene where the girls get powered up.

    Hi <strong>Red</strong>, that is exactly what my husband said - they now have the choice to use it. However, my problem is that I don't see it as a choice because who <em>wouldn't</em> use that sort of power?

    I know that <em>watching</em> it makes my heart lift but at the same time it bothers me.

    I'm all for tapping your inner power and I admire the work that you do.

  content: "I think the choice is, as Andy said, being in control of yourself. The
    women all had the potential to be slayers, but hundreds of years ago a group of
    men decided to withhold that power from all but one woman at a time. And that
    one woman <i>had</i> to be the Slayer. More men &ndash; and sometimes women,
    I guess, since we did see female wathers &ndash; made sure that she used that
    power in a very specific way. And the events concerning Faith in season three
    suggest that they would use extreme measures against women who didn't conform
    to their expectations of the Slayer. \r\n\r\nSo Buffy empowers all of the potentials,
    giving them back the power they were born with. Now they have the choice to do
    whatever they want with that power. They can become Slayers or they don't have
    to. You ask who wouldn't use that sort of power and maybe very few wouldn't. But
    I must say that living a life constantly at battle with creatures who want to
    kill me doesn't sound like a life I would particularly care for. I'd rather use
    my Slayer strength for opening tightly sealed jars or maybe building a house.
    \r\n\r\nI think Whedon is trying to suggest that these women now have access to
    the power they were born with, and they may use that power however they choose,
    whether it's slaying vampires, playing softball, or standing up for themselves.\r\n\r\nNow
    having said all that, I really don't like this episode as a series finale. Buffy
    had a half-assed plan and Spike had to save them all? BULL.SHIT."

  content: "The other night I watched Sayid, Jin, and Sun die on \"Lost\" and even
    though I never miss an eppie of \"Lost\", I didn't really have much of a reaction
    to 3 main characters meeting their maker within the space of 5 minutes. So how
    is it that a show as ridiculously unrealistic as BtVS so often finds a way to
    bring a tear to my eye? \r\n\r\nI put off viewing Buffy's series finale for a
    few days because series finales are a bitch. They're like an execution, only instead
    of gassing a serial killer, it's cherished TV buddies that get put down for all
    eternity. No more dusting vamps, or diving off of towers, no more resurrection
    spells or waiting for an invitation before crossing a threshold. \r\n\r\nMy journey
    with Buffy is over, but it was a sweet ride while it lasted. I have to say that
    I preferred S7 over S6, but I think S5 will remain my favourite because of the
    sheer awesomeness of \"The Gift\". \r\n\r\nI didn't realize that The Trio were
    going to be such a presence in S7. I couldn't stand them in S6, but I must say
    that I came to be a fan of Andrew in S7. The best thing that ever happened to
    him was being apprehended by Willow and brought to live in the Summers house.
    Andrew was essentially a good kid who got mixed up with the wrong crowd and he
    redeemed himself nicely as the series drew to a close. I also credit Andrew with
    the funniest moment of S7 (for me) when Anya was lecturing the Potential in the
    basement and yammering about having breakup sex with Xander. Andrew, taking useless
    notes and illustrating on the fly as Anya speaks, quickly scribbles 'breakup sex'
    on the drawing board beside her. The absurdity of that moment in front of the
    Potentials, and in the face of such imminent danger, had me laughing out loud.
    And, much to Andrew's credit, he picked up a weapon and fought the evil uber vamps
    (without any benefit from Willow's spell) in the final battle. I'm extremely grateful
    to the writers that they left Warren and Jonathan out of the last few episodes.
    \r\n\r\nI wasn't always a fan of Anya, and I didn't care anything about her and
    Xander's marriage plans, but I admired her a lot for sticking around to fight
    at the end. She died a horrible and lonely human death, but she took one for the
    team, and I hope they found time to remember her sacrifice before heading off
    to the mall. Odd that the one who seemed most moved by her death was Andrew. Xander
    kind of shrugged it off quickly and no one else even asked about her. Maybe she
    should have got out of town when she could if that's all the thanks she got.\r\n\r\nHow
    did Giles end up losing his mojo? He used to be a role model and a mentor for
    the Scoobies, but somehow he lost his way. I think it goes back to \"The Gift\",
    when he suggested killing Dawn. He was never the same after that and in S7 he
    was as much a hindrance to Buffy as a help. Plotting to kill Spike and being part
    of the mutiny that kicked Buffy out of her own house. C'mon, Giles, this is Buffy,
    the vampire slayer, YOUR slayer, and your getting in her way like this? \r\n\r\nAnd,
    on the subject of killing Dawn, suddenly Buffy decides Dawn is expendable if it
    means saving the world???? There is no way in hell that Buffy would allow that
    to happen. Dawn, IMO, was 'the gift' from S5. Buffy would die again rather than
    see any harm come to Dawn.\r\n\r\nI wasn't a hater of The Potentials, but I have
    to say I didn't like Kennedy zeroing in on Willow. Willow moved on from Tara way
    too soon for my liking. I wouldn't have shed a tear had Kennedy succumbed to an
    Uber Vamp in the end. \r\n\r\nDawn and Spike. Whatever happened to those two?
    Ever since that motorbike ride at the beginning of S6, they barely exchanged 2
    words for the remaining 2 seasons. I liked them together in S5. I thought Spike
    was at his most likable when he was given the responsibility of looking out for
    the Niblet. Gotta say I love that Andrew 'dawned' Dawn's football helmet for his
    ride with Spike. Nice touch.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't that long ago that Spike recounted
    for Buffy the story of how he killed the 2 slayers, and yet when Principal Wood
    tells Buffy that his slayer mom was killed by a vamp, it doesn't occur to Buffy
    that he's talking about Spike? I found that very strange. \r\n\r\nWhat was this
    rubbish about Xander being 'the seer'? The writers set it up with that 'you're
    extraordinary' speech he gave to Dawnie and then Caleb mentioned it before poking
    out X's eye. Xander was just a schmuck who meant well, he wasn't any seer. \r\n\r\nOne
    of the Potentials must have been a hairdresser, because everyone's hair changed
    from minute to minute. Spike was all slicked back one minute, and then all home-permed
    the next. Dawn's hair is perfectly straight in the house and then she jumps in
    the car a minute later sporting the whole crimped look. Spike said \"it's always
    about the blood\", but I think it was always about the hair. \r\n\r\nI'm glad
    I spent 144 episodes with Buffy. It's sad to have to let go, but I still have
    one more season of \"Angel\" before I leave the Buffyverse once and for all. BtVS
    was a great series, full of ridiculous, impossible situations, but Whedon and
    company managed, at one time or another, to manipulate every kind of emotion out
    of me and that's what I watch these shows for. I want to laugh and cry and everything
    in between and I certainly did that with Buffy and her friends. Well done to all
    concerned.\r\n\r\nBTW, I watched the Paleyfest Buffy Reunion, and while the Q
    and A itself was kind of a snooze, I really appreciated the photos that came out
    that session simply because it brought together actors that played such an important
    role in the series and yet never met on screen. So we have pics of Cordelia with
    Dawn and Tara and I think that's really pretty neat (or nifty as Willow might
    say). Not only that, but that event brought Cordy and Tara and Anya back to life,
    which also lent to the warm and fuzzy vibe. Pity that a few key players were not
    at that reunion."

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2540" title="Chosen - Buffy and the Scythe" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Buffy-and-the-Scythe.jpg" alt="Chosen - Buffy and the Scythe" width="534" height="300" /><br />
<strong>Chosen</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chosen&rdquo; is not the best season finale (seasons 2, 3 and 5 have better ones) but it is an adequate way to end the entire series. I have major issues with the empowerment spell and with the huge role that Spike plays in the conclusion and that taints it for me.</p>
<p>Joss Whedon has this to say about Buffy&rsquo;s cookie dough speech: &ldquo;She comes to this conclusion a little bit out of the blue, and that's my fault, but we knew that emotionally, that's where we wanted her to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this about the Scythe: &ldquo;Some people have complained that the magic that this Scythe &ndash; originally from the <em>Fray</em> comic that I was writing at the same time &ndash; is a little too convenient. And my answer to those critics is, "Well, don't tell everybody!" It is convenient, and that doesn't really bother me, because ultimately, to me, the magic, the <a href="http://www.triviaguide.net/phlebotnum/">phlebotnum</a> is always secondary to what needs to be said. And what needed to be said had to do with empowerment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this about the Ubervamps: &ldquo;Some people complained, again, that the vampires were too easy to kill. That they were supposed to be stronger than other vampires. And the fact of the matter is&hellip; it's true. Like the convenience of the magic, it's true. Because, again, I was more interested in showing the empowerment than I was in the continuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three quotes from Joss Whedon&rsquo;s commentary to &lsquo;Chosen&rdquo; (transcript by <a href="http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/53253.html">stormwreath</a>) make it clear that he doesn&rsquo;t care if a story is a little strained if the story being told has heart. However, what happens if the heart is in the wrong place?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2538" title="Chosen - Anya" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Anya.jpg" alt="Chosen - Anya" width="534" height="300" /><br />
This is what he says about Anya: &ldquo;That was because I needed a toll, I needed this battle really to feel like a battle &ndash; and I couldn't kill any of my Core Four and still call it a happy ending. I couldn't kill Dawn and still call it a happy ending either. So Anya got the nod. And to make it as unheroic as possible just felt very real and very creepy &ndash; and that shot was in fact her last shot.&rdquo; (I like that Anya was steeled by the thought of bunnies but, otherwise, just another woman to add to the pile.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2539" title="Chosen - Spike" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Spike.jpg" alt="Chosen - Spike" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what he says about Spike: &ldquo;Another beautiful image. Our boy, going down for the last time. Even though everybody already knew he was going to be on <em>Angel</em>...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t! I thought he was bloody dead. And answer this question: who gets to die in a literal blaze of glory and whose body is left buried under Sunnydale? Many people die in <em>Buffy</em> and, in a series with a disproportionate amount of female characters (compared with any other TV series that is), many of them are women. What I resent is the number of women who die compared with the number of men who leave rather than get killed off. And this Spike thing is even more galling. He dies (completely incinerated) and yet there he is in bloody <em>Angel</em>. Joss is famous for his character deaths which are tremendously resonant and powerfully effective which some people justify by pointing out that death happens and is even more likely to be early and violent in the Buffyverse (this is undeniable) but when the deceased return from the dead then where is the power in that?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2543" title="Chosen - Willow " src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-Willow.jpg" alt="Chosen - Willow " width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I have problems with the empowerment of thousands of young potentials; not with the ones that Buffy explicitly asks if they want to do this thing (&ldquo;So here's the part where you make a choice&hellip;&rdquo;) but with the ones who have it thrust upon them. It is done without their consent. How is Buffy different from the Shadow Men who did the same to the first Slayer? When she met them in &ldquo;Get It Done&rdquo; she is miffed with what they did to the First Slayer &ldquo;You violated that girl, made her kill for you because you're weak, you're pathetic, and you obviously have nothing to show me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few other remarks:</p>
<p>If you are going to use lines like &ldquo;he had to split&rdquo;, it really helps when the character then laughs at its cheesiness.</p>
<p>Dawn kicking Buffy in the shin is acceptable violence.</p>
<p>Spike's drawing of Angel on the punchbag is amusing.</p>
<p>I liked Robin and Faith together. Faith&rsquo;s horror at, perhaps, not being that great at sex was most amusing ("Dude, I got mad skills."). However, I don&rsquo;t like Robin&rsquo;s &ldquo;death&rdquo;. Back to Joss: &ldquo;Dying &ndash; having a character die then suddenly bringing them back is something you can only earn after you've actually killed a couple of people. So this was a nice opportunity to say, "This isn&rsquo;t over yet." Have the call-back and &ndash; but I wouldn't have been able to do it if I hadn't legitimately offed a few beloved characters.&rdquo; I really detest that fake-out storytelling: it feels like cheating to me and is also a tad repetitive since it had already been done to Cordelia and Kaylee.</p>
<p>Giles and the others playing Dungeons and Dragons was also amusing particularly since he summed up his S7 persona: "I used to be a highly respected watcher, and      now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily."</p>
<p>After reading Joss&rsquo;s words, I should know better than to complain but Buffy&rsquo;s plan could really have done with better timing like waiting for Willow&rsquo;s spell to, um, work.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2541" title="Chosen - buffy, xander, giles, willow" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/Chosen-the-four.jpg" alt="Chosen - buffy, xander, giles, willow" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I love the lull before the final fight as other characters disappear to get on with their tasks leaving the original four in the high school corridor and a shot of Buffy on her own: Giles&rsquo;s remark the &ldquo;earth is definitely doomed&rdquo; is a perfect reminder of&nbsp; &ldquo;The Harvest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What happens to Kennedy? I&rsquo;m pretty sure we never see her after the escape from the Hellmouth. It seems a bit odd not to have a proper shot of her on the bus.</p>
<p>The Welcome to Sunnydale sigh falling into the crater is an important touch.</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s last words are &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spike&rdquo; which surely somebody has analysed the significance of.</p>
<p>In the final, final scene, I like that Buffy doesn&rsquo;t say anything while everyone yammers but just smiles, sadly.</p>
