These are quotes from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100350780">an interview with Joss Whedon about <em>Dollhouse</em> by Jacki Lyden</a> on npr's <em>All Things Considered</em> on 8th February 2008.</p>

<li>It is uncomfortable.</li><br>
<li>True. A trope. Boring.</li><br>
<li>I'm think Joss fails in this respect. This series has reminded me of the Angel episode called "Billy" when Wes is handed his inner misogynist and tries to kill Fred. This is perhaps the most heavy-handed example of Joss and co failing to "show, don't tell" but "Stage Fright" is pretty unsubtle too. I do realise both episodes were not written by Joss himself but he's in charge. <em>Mad Men</em> is an exploration of misogyny but I have yet to hear anyone say the words "hate" and "women" unlike Wes who actually gets to hammer it home: "What do you tell a woman who has two black eyes?&nbsp; Nothing you haven't already told her twice."</li><br>
<li>I'm not angry. However, I am disappointed that such serious stuff is being presented via poor scripts.</li><br />
