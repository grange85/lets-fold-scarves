<p>I was just writing another blog post while listening to a free CD that came with Word magazine and the sweet vocals of Ben Taylor (son of Carly Simon and James Taylor (and you can tell)) came to my attention as he sang "Wicked Way":</p>
<blockquote><p>I just want to take you out and get you drunk so I can have my wicked way with you<br />
I'm just being honest cause I know the other guys are thinking just the same way too<br />
And I'm not gonna lie and say that I will take you out to dance there's just no chance cause I don't even like the same music you do<br />
I just wanna have my wicked way with you<br />
So don't you fight it cause I know you're gonna like it<br />
Show me some skin I might bite it<br />
I wanna have my wicked way with you</blockquote></p>
<p>Thanks Ben for a song that is obviously amusing and sweet and not at all offensive.</p>
