  content: I found it hard to relate to "There Will Be Blood," and perhaps that's
    why. It was a very male film.

  content: I'm not necessarily adverse to manly films. I really like <em>Fight Club</em>,
    <em>Gattaca</em> and <em>The Godfather</em> for example. I'm not keen
    on films where women should be part of the film but are just plain absent. Any
    film about family should have mothers, sisters, aunts, wives, lovers, daughters,
    nieces, etc.

  content: "There were women around the periphery in \"There Will Be Blood\", but
    they were inconsequential to the story. This was a story about just one thing
    - a man and his growing megalomania, and it was unpleasant to watch.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, I found \"No Country for Old Men\" fascinating, despite only having
    one female character. The difference was, she was important to the story, and
    the other characters (except for one), behaved in ways I could understand and
    relate to. It was a much more human film."

<p>I just came across <a href="http://bechdel.nullium.net/">this website</a> devoted to the Bechdel Test (via <a href="http://gabrielleabelle.livejournal.com/">My Buffyholism is Showing</a>).</p>
<p>Why haven't I seen the Oscar winning film <em>There Will Be Blood</em>? Because a film styled as a "story about <strong><em>family</em></strong>, greed, religion, and oil, centered around a turn-of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business" which has "<img src="http://bechdel.nullium.net/img/nowomen.png" alt="[Red cross icon]" /> Less than two women in [it]" is simply not high on my list.</p>
