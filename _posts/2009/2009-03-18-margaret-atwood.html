    this site, looking for new Buffy episode reviews. \r\nAnd Le Guin's \"The Birthday
    of the World\" is lying not very far away :-)"

  content: "Cool.\r\n\r\nI was listening to the Le Guin interview because I was hoping
    for inspiration. I like the idea of her work because it's science fiction/fantasy
    and she deals with sexism and racism but I haven't read any of her work. That's
    not quite true because I have started reading <i>The Wizard of Earthsea</i>
    at least twice and I've just not got into it. \r\n\r\nWhat would you recommend?\r\n\r\nI
    have <i>The Blind Assassin</i> on my shelves - one of my many to-be-read books.\r\n\r\n\"Entropy\"
    is on its way."

  content: I like <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> by LeGuin, but it took me a
    while to get into that one too.

  content: "I'm just halfway through <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, although I've
    had this forever because I tend to hoard books even if I have so little time to
    read. I'm loving it so far and I can see now why it's considered to be one of
    the best novels of all time. But maybe that's also because I tend to like literary
    fiction. \r\n\r\nBut, you know what, after watching Buffy, I suddenly had this
    intense urge to go into science fiction/fantasy and so I bought the Le Guin.
    I actually haven't started that one; after watching the movie <i>The Jane Austen
    Book Club</i> (which mentioned <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>), I made
    a mental note that I'll start with Le Guin. :)"

<p>"I'm a reader of science fiction and fantasy" - Margaret Atwood in <em>Ursula Le Guin at 80</em> BBC Radio 4 17th March 2009 at 11:30</p>
<p>I thought at first (due to her accent) that Margaret was confessing to <em>be a writer</em> of science fiction...</p>
