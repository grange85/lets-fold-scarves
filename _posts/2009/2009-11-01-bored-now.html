  content: "I really enjoyed reading these as you went through. I'm also with you
    on limiting future rewatches to the first four seasons, plus selected later episodes.
    In fact, when I was buying the season sets, I only bought the first four seasons,
    and had a friend burn copies of \"The Body\" and \"Once More With Feeling\" on
    DVD for me -- the only later episodes I actually wanted to own. \r\n\r\nYes, I
    eventually wound up with all seven seasons because I found The Chosen Collection
    on sale at a can't-pass-it-up bargain price. But I seriously doubt I'll ever rewatch
    S5, S6 or S7 in their entirety."

  content: "I have all the seasons, but I start picking and choosing episodes starting
    in season 4 (although I enjoyed that season - as well as season 5 - more on a
    second viewing than I did the first time). \r\n\r\nI have a tradition, now in
    it's 4th year, of watching Buffy on Halloween night. I watched Lie To Me, Halloween,
    What's My Line parts 1 &amp; 2 while the trick-or-treater's were coming to my
    door. \r\n\r\nI think one of my very favorite Buffy moments ever is when Willow,
    as a ghost, walks into the library and scares Giles. It makes me laugh, every
    time."

  content: It was really enjoyable to read your thoughts on this.  I mostly agree.  I
    think I'm a little more enthusiastic about S5, and a little more angry about S7,
    but that's about it.

    of your views (i hardly ever watch S4 and i love S5). Your obvious passion for
    the show and the characters has been really engaging and stimulating, i don't
    need to read subjective opinions that just happen to chime with my own - what
    would be the point? Your blog has made me think, scurry off to re-watch, laugh
    out loud and howl in pain. Pretty much like the show then! \r\n\r\nThanks for
    being so patient with all the comments from people and good luck with whatever
    becomes your next focus. \r\n\r\n'best,\r\nwytch"

<p><a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/?p=2529">This</a> was quite obviously my final episode review of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>. I started this &ldquo;project&rdquo; in (no, really?) on <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2006/04/20/its-almost-but-not-like-watching-it-for-the-first-time/">20th April 2006</a> (when I was 41) and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself along the way. I am greatly chuffed by the number of people who have taken the time to make comments which were without exception more thoughtful and analytical than I ever managed. (I defend myself by pointing out that I never thought I was being smart.)</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://www.englishchick.com/joan.htm">Joan the English Chick</a> and the other folks who transcribed all the episodes, the folks over at <a href="http://www.screencap-paradise.com/?page_id=2">Screencap Paradise</a> whose screencaps saved me a lot of time, and all the <a href="http://www.criticallytouched.com/buffy/reviews.php">bloggers</a> and <a href="http://stormwreath.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> keepers who have given me so much to think about. I am in awe of their <a href="http://gabrielleabelle.livejournal.com/">talent</a> and insight.</p>
<p>I have now watched every episode twice and some I have seen many, many times (and there are more that I have seen parts of many, many times). However, if I want to spend another three and a bit years of my life doing another rewatch, I will only watch S1-4 again and selected episodes from 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<p>S5 is where it gets &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; and where, too often, it fails to match its ambition and is disappointingly unengaging and unconvincing.</p>
<p>My favourite characters are Willow and Tara and, while I adore S4 Tara and Willow, too often thereafter they are a rather boring couple.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly great episodes after S4 but overall the seasons are troublesome and I have to put it down to one thing: Spike gets a crush on Buffy. I loved evil Spike and chipped Spike but, after he fell for Buffy, I became irritated as the show focused on Spike and his relationship with Buffy. I am not that interested in any of my heroines' relationships with their significant others. The great thing about Buffy and Angel was that when they did get together it unleashed Angelus which put the kibosh on romance (for the most part).</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons I loved Tara and Willow&rsquo;s burgeoning relationship was precisely because it was obscured by metaphors. The explicit course of the relationship between Kennedy and Willow was a literal turn-off for me. Even Oz and Willow's relationship was sweet and somewhat na&iuml;ve which made it endearing (and they became boring too). And, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t Willow's show and we weren't treated to episode after episode exploring her relationships.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </em>in one word, I would call it layered. It is fluffy, profound, funny, heartbreaking, silly, serious, exciting, sad, entertaining, thought-provoking, groundbreaking, and add your own. It also boasted sensational outfits because ultimately that is what mattered*.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2527" align="aligncenter" width="535" caption="Willow&#39;s top is so awful that it makes Tara&#39;s look nice"]<img class="size-full wp-image-2527" title="After Life - the worst top ever?" src="/images/uploads/2009/11/After-Life-the-worst-top-ever.jpg" alt="Willow's top is so awful that it makes Tara's look nice" width="535" height="300" />[/caption]</p>
<p>*<small>Or maybe what really mattered was friendship and family because when you lose your friends and family you get S7.</small></p>
