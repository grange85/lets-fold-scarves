<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Awakening"</strong> (David Fury &amp; Steven S. DeKnight)</p>
<p>I'm sorry but with Angelus's laughter bothering my eardrums at the end of this, I realised that I can no longer bring myself to blog about <em>Angel</em>. I can only tolerate the show so much and the thought of having to think about it again after my viewing experience is over is simply unbearable.</p>
<p>*the fact that she didn't say "no" may sum up <em>Angel</em> in some way...</p>
