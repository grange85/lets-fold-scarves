  content: I read Gunn's response to be that he would prefer to "sweet talk a nasty
    little girl" and Fred's own response is to agree except that she says "yeah, I
    gotta disagree". So that's why I'm confused...!

<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Habeas Corpses"</strong> (Jeffrey Bell)</p>
<p>A great title or a naff one?</p>
<p>There was a whole pile of stuff in this that cannot bear close scrutiny which I find irritatingly sloppy. And that's another reason why <em>Angel</em> is pants. It is crazy sloppy far too much of the time. Episodes often feel like they have been thrown together like they have been made in a hurry which, of course, was frequently the case but that's no excuse for carelessness. For example: what makes Wesley think that the beast "won't quit 'til everyone at Wolfram and Hart is dead"? Another: why when Cordelia is a proven fighter isn't she allowed to go to Wolfram &amp; Hart while Fred is? (real answer: the actress playing Cordelia is pregnant, show's answer: erm). And the building is in lockdown and there are still ways in and out. It's either in lockdown or it isn't.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2217" title="Habeas Corpses - Lorne and Cordy" src="/images/uploads/2009/08/Habeas-Corpses-Lorne-and-Cordy.jpg" alt="Habeas Corpses - Lorne and Cordy"   /></p>
<p>And this dialogue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gunn: So, fight seven floors of evil lawyer zombies or sweet talk a nasty little girl? You know where my heart's at.<br />
Fred: Yeah, I gotta disagree. I vote for the white room. How do we get there?</blockquote><br />
doesn't make any sense at all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2216" title="Habeas Corpses - Connor and Lilah" src="/images/uploads/2009/08/Habeas-Corpses-Connor-and-Lilah.jpg" alt="Habeas Corpses - Connor and Lilah"   /></p>
<p>Is this farewell to Lilah and Stephanie Romanov for the time being? Please don't actually answer that question. As much as I like her, half the time her character is treated poorly, and I don't like that. In a single scene with Wesley she gets to sexually humiliate herself and make a racist remark.</p>
<p>And gawd, how boring is the incessant sniping between Gunn and Wesley? Extremely boring and nonsensical.</p>
<p>At least we were spared more than an episode of Angel seething over Cordelia sleeping with Connor.</p>
