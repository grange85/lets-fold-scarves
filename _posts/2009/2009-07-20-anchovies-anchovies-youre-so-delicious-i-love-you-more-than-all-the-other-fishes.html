    they're all great).\r\n\r\nI'm curious about your take on the absence of Tara.
    \ Since you're such a big AB fan and she chose not to appear here - do you agree
    with her, fault her or neutrally defer to her judgement?"

  content: "A lot of people call this episode the best of season seven because it's
    a typical Joss high-concept affair, but I think that distinction belongs to \"Selfless.\"
    Willow and The Trio's stories work for me, but Buffy's is too pretentious and
    talky and Dawn's is a combination of poorly written and poorly executed.\r\n<blockquote>Check.
    Check. Check. Check. Check. Check.</blockquote><blockquote>\"That boy is our
    last hope.\"\r\n\"No, there is another.\"\r\nWait, really? Who's our last hope?\r\nNo,
    I was just going with it. It was a thing. He's our last hope.</blockquote>Dare
    I say I like the Trio in this episode? Also, Adam Busch is awesome here. As much
    as I dislike Warren, I think AB did a fantastic job. I would have much rather
    had Jonathan around all season instead of Andrew, though I understand that the
    relationship dynamics between the three guys makes the situation that plays out
    the most realistic. It doesn't seem fair to me that Jonathan, who has been on
    the show since the beginning, gets gutted here, and Andrew gets to stick around
    forever. (He's still in the comics! WHY?!?) But I do like the dramatic effect
    of Andrew killing Jonathan, so I'll just lament that Whedon &amp; Co. decided
    to keep Andrew around all season, hogging screen time from characters I actually
    care about, but he's in good company there with all the Slayerettes running around,
    seducing my favorite redheaded witch who wasn't near ready for a new girlfriend,
    especially one as bratty and charmless as...\r\n\r\nSorry. I'm back.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, you're much kinder to Dawn than I can be. Some of the boo elements in her
    story are very effective &ndash; I find it chilling when Joyce's body appears
    on the couch &ndash; but Michelle Trachtenberg's overacting kills that story for
    me. And she DESTROYS the house. Way more than she has to. I can't help it &mdash;
    excessive property damage just bugs me.\r\n\r\nI find Buffy's story too navel-gazey
    and boring, though Holden does get in a couple of good one-liners. But I think
    his diagnosis of her is wrong. Yes, Buffy has a superiority complex, but I think
    her inferiority complex has more to do with feeling like she won't or can't live
    up to whatever expectations have been placed on her shoulders by the universe.
    (And I don't think that combo of neuroses is actually that uncommon in really
    talented people.) She's also got a bit of a martyr complex thrown in there as
    well.\r\n\r\nWillow's storyline is probably my favorite (surprise surprise). I'm
    of two minds about whether I would have wanted Amber Benson to have said Cassie's
    lines. Part of me thinks it would have ripped my heart out to see Tara as evil,
    even if it wasn't really Tara. But the other part of me recognizes that because
    it would have affected me like that, it really would have hit home the mental
    torments the First was trying to visit on our heroines. (I'm ignoring you, Andrew.)
    I must say that I was happy to see Azura Skye again, and I think she really sells
    the material as best as any actor who isn't Amber Benson could. As always, Alyson
    Hannigan is fantastic at crying and making me well up when she says to the heavens
    that, \"it hurts so much. Everyday, it's like this giant hole, and it's not getting
    better.\" Plus, take a picture! Willow is grieving and talking about Tara! She
    even says her name! This ain't gonna happen again for a little while, and then
    it'll be like Tara never existed.\r\n\r\nI really like the opening song performed
    by Angie Hart! (of Frente! and Splendid!). The framing device of that performance
    works for me for some reason, even though it doesn't connect with anything else
    in the story.\r\n\r\nI understand why Xander isn't in this episode. He hasn't
    had any significant people in his life die (and not come back to life), so who
    was he going to talk to? The other conversations don't lend themselves to Xander
    tagging along, and having him talk to a vampire too would be redundant. Frankly,
    his absence doesn't really bother me, though it's probably a sad portent of how
    the core characters become pushed to the fringe during this season."

  content: "Blimey, <strong>Stephanie</strong>, your comment is longer than my
    original post! Of course, you vigorously add a great deal to my thoughts about
    the episode.\r\n\r\nThe Trio are great in this episode. I know I feel odd typing
    that too. Andrew&rsquo;s murder of Jonathan is awful. \r\n\r\nI am saving any
    remarks on the subject of Kennedy until she appears because I have liked S7 so
    much so far that I&rsquo;m scared&hellip;\r\n\r\nIf I was in my haunted home in
    supernatural Sunnydale where really weird things happen and I was being haunted
    by my dead mother, I too would overact and thoroughly smash the house up. So Dawn
    is okay by me. Her story also gains points for her &ldquo;anchovies&rdquo; line
    and the microwaving of a giant marshmallow.\r\n\r\nI wasn&rsquo;t listening to
    the dialogue in Buffy&rsquo;s story too closely. I&rsquo;m not very good at immediately
    grasping the meaning of blocks of the spoken word (for example, Shakespeare is
    hard for me to comprehend unless I read the text). I wrote this response to &ldquo;CWDP&rdquo;
    without reading the transcript (I usually do so to pick out quotes but in this
    case I stopped at &ldquo;anchovies&rdquo;) so it is my reaction to watching it
    again after a three year or so gap. I loved the way Buffy and Holden talked to
    each other, their acting and the blue way it looked. Is it pretentious? Definitely.
    I don&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s Joss. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Plus, take a picture! Willow
    is grieving and talking about Tara! She even says her name! This ain&rsquo;t gonna
    happen again for a little while, and then it&rsquo;ll be like Tara never existed.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI
    can hardly believe I forgot to mention these facts."

    <i>thoughts</i>. What else am I going to do with them besides post them on
    your blog, Hazel? :-)\r\n\r\nIn regards to why Amber did not return, she says
    (as in you can see the words come out of her mouth) in the <i>Buffy</i> panel
    at PaleyFest that the main reason she did not return for this episode was because
    it conflicted with her flying to England to direct the <i>Ghosts of Albion</i>
    series. That she wasn't sure about playing Tara as evil might have made her hesitate
    to accept the offer, but I think scheduling also had a lot to do with it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I can actually see where she is coming from with the reasoning articulated at
    the BBC. I think that she (and supposedly Joss) were really surprised how upset
    Tara's death made people, so I can understand her impulse to tread carefully with
    playing an evil version of Tara."

    Amber acting as Tara/The First. \r\n[ http://www.buffyworld.com/buffy/scripts/129_scri.html
    ]\r\n\r\nAs much as I am a devoted W/T shipper, I honestly couldn't tell you
    which one I imagine to be more chilling-Azura or Amber. Either way, it breaks
    my heart. The fact that Tara isn't there and Willow breaks down the way she does
    and it <i>still</i> makes me cry is a testament to both the emotional impact
    and point of the scene, and Aly's acting-crying chops do more than enough to make
    my eyes prickle. The integrity of Willow's scenes are captured sans Tara, and
    that to me was very well done. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Willow is grieving and talking about
    Tara! She even says her name! This ain&rsquo;t gonna happen again for a little
    while, and then it&rsquo;ll be like Tara never existed\" \r\n\r\n-I third this
    notion. The non-talky-Tara thing really irks me the entire season, I just can't
    get over it. In many instances the show swept heavy issues under the rug and most
    were never heard from again, and if so only in small ways. But Tara's death was
    the trigger for literally almost ending the world, and even to take it out of
    'season finale action' context, this single event probably changes Willow's life
    more irrevocably than any other. It's like Joyce's death for Buffy and Jenny/Buffy's
    death for Giles except way, way worse. I guess I just feel that the Scoobs really
    fell flat on getting each others' emotional backs, but on the Tara issue more
    than any other."

  content: "Hazel, good call. I think each character has had issues that are almost
    completely ignored and never really brought up or mentioned again in the series.
    Willow and Xander never talk about Jesse, Jenny is rarely (if not ever) brought
    up after S3, Willow and Xander never talk about their home lives despite it being...less
    than ideal, Buffy (and Dawn, I suppose) don't talk about their Father, I mean
    the list goes on. Dawn, actually doesn't talk about Tara much in S7 either, despite
    being second closest to her. \r\n\r\nIt's almost as if the Scoobies care to talk
    about and deal with issues on everything besides themselves throughout the course
    of the show. It's fascinating sometimes, but often leads to negative consequences.
    There's a whole meta on how best-traits become fatal flaws in S6 ( http://elisi.livejournal.com/179224.html
    ). It really made me think about things in a new way. \r\n\r\nBut, Tara. Alas,
    she joins the list of under rug swept things that becomes a silent issue. But
    as a second-tier Scooby alongside Spike, Anya, and Dawn (for the sake of the issue,
    I added Spike in there cause I liked him that way :) ) I guess I expected more
    than muteness. Oh, well. Fail."

  content: "It's true that Jenny/Doyle/Joyce fans might feel snubbed, just
    as Tara fans do. But in regards to Jenny and Doyle, they weren't on their respective
    shows as long as Tara, and neither of them were portrayed as Giles or Cordy's
    soulmates by any means. Personally, I think that they receive a decent/appropriate
    amount of recognition after their deaths. As for Joyce, I feel like she was mentioned
    a decent amount and Kristine Sutherland appeared on the show four times after
    Joyce died. So even if the characters didn't talk about her, her presence suggested
    that they (and the showrunners) were still thinking about her.\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, Tara was on the show for two years, and clearly was very important to Willow,
    at least as important as Angel was to Buffy. Joss Whedon, Amber Benson, and Alyson
    Hannigan have said as much that Tara died because they needed to take away what
    Willow cared about the most to make her hit rock bottom. If losing Tara was supposed
    to (and indeed did) have that much of an impact on Willow, I just can't understand
    why the writers wouldn't mention her more the following season. What she did in
    \"Villains\" through \"Grave\" was not the same as grieving.\r\n\r\nAlso, in regards
    to the \"To Amber Benson or not Amber Benson\" debate, I would have been sad if
    the last time I saw Tara, or at least something that looked like her, she was
    actually evil. I would have wanted Amber to appear again before the end of season
    7 if she had been able to guest star in this episode."

    "Oh, well. Fail."

    Absolutely. I was being a bit disingenuous. Tara was a major character who was portrayed by someone who was a major cast member despite not being in the credits (and we can debate more about that too!) and she was treated shabbily by people who didn't care about her. Tara was a <a href="https://www.moley75.co.uk/2008/12/25/i-wont-tell-anyone-i-wouldnt-do-that/#comment-601" rel="nofollow">plot device</a>.

    "So even if the characters didn&rsquo;t talk about her, her presence suggested that they (and the showrunners) were still thinking about her."

    Absolutely. They clearly (the showrunners) really liked KS.

<p><strong>Conversations With Dead People </strong>(Jane Espenson &amp; Drew Goddard)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2146" title="conversations with dead people - joyce" src="/images/uploads/2009/07/convo-joyce.jpg" alt="conversations with dead people - joyce"   /></p>
<p>One of the signs of great writing is to introduce a stranger into a cast of familiar characters and have the audience care about the interactions between the stranger and the well-known. This failed miserably in &ldquo;The Message&rdquo; (written by Joss Whedon and Tim Minear) where Jonathan M. Woodward played Tracey so it isn&rsquo;t Woodward that made the trick work. Joss wrote the scenes between Buffy and Holden so it&rsquo;s obviously something he can&rsquo;t pull off every time. Andy made the point that Buffy clearly doesn&rsquo;t remember Holden at all so she has no advantage over us (via in-jokes and shared memories, for example). This suggests to me that &ldquo;The Message&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t work because the Browncoats remembered Tracey while we didn&rsquo;t. Plus the story was execrable.</p>
<p>Although Jane Espenson and Drew Goddard are credited with writing the episode it was actually broken down like this: JE wrote Dawn&rsquo;s story, DG wrote the Trio&rsquo;s, Marti Noxon wrote Willow&rsquo;s and Joss Whedon wrote Buffy&rsquo;s. I wonder what happened to the person who wrote Xander&rsquo;s&hellip; It is rather a kick in the chops that after six seasons the writers thought that Xander didn&rsquo;t have a role to play in this important episode.</p>
<p>Spike has no dialogue and yet his story is told effectively and ends horrifically when he is revealed as a killer again.</p>
<p>Horror is the name of the game as Dawn&rsquo;s story unfolds. It may be classic horror but it was also genuinely scary and revealed how resourceful and brave she can be. Such wasted potential.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2148" title="conversations with dead people - dawn" src="/images/uploads/2009/07/convo-dawn.jpg" alt="conversations with dead people - dawn"   /></p>
<p>I loved the character interaction between Buffy and Holden. The actors played off each other well. It is sometimes easy to open up to strangers. The look of sadness, dismay and thoughtfulness on Buffy&rsquo;s face after she dusts Holden is nicely played by SMG who is, shall I say it again?, absolutely fabulous as Buffy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2151" title="conversations with dead people - buffy" src="/images/uploads/2009/07/convo-buffy.jpg" alt="conversations with dead people - buffy"   /></p>
<p>&ldquo;She's sorry she couldn't come herself.&rdquo; says Cassie, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in dispute.&rdquo; said Andy. Only a handful know the whole truth about Amber Benson&rsquo;s absence but it is a great loss to <em>BtVS</em> that she wasn&rsquo;t in this. There is no doubt in my mind that if Amber had been in this then it would have been awesome and the episode would probably be in my top ten. Tara egging on Willow to commit suicide, Willow&rsquo;s dawning comprehension, Tara&rsquo;s mocking &ldquo;Oh, baby, you left such a big hole. It hurt so bad.&rdquo; &ndash; all of that would have been amazing. The  great &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; of <em>BtVS</em>. However, despite the oddity of Cassie (a character who Willow had never even met) being used to get at Willow, this still packs a punch. Alyson Hannigan is particularly good as she realises she has been had.</p>

<p>When Jonathan and Andrew appeared on my screen I gave a Pavlovian groan but their story was compelling and Andrew&rsquo;s murder of Jonathan after being easily tricked by &ldquo;Warren&rdquo; was excellent drama. Unfortunately, the arrival of Andrew leads to the marginalization of other characters in his favour.</p>

However, there is more Andrew to come and a bunch of Potentials and maybe my memory of them is not wrong. On the other hand, Faith!</p>
