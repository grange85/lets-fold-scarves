<p>Two blog posts from outside my usual <em>Mad Men</em> sphere brought me up short when I read them and made me think: do I actually like <em>Mad Men</em>?</p>
<p>It can be hard work and it is dour and oppressive. The sixties weren't that miserable. Self-Styled Siren <a href="http://selfstyledsiren.blogspot.com/2009/09/ten-melos-siren-would-watch-instead-of.html">has a post</a> on the whole <em>dour</em>ness of it and suggests watching films from the period instead. Now, I find it hard to like or, indeed, find films from that era so I'm not so sure though I guess <em>North By Northwest</em> could be a good start (ok, not a melodrama). It is, after all, also about an incredibly handsome ad executive... I'm wittering but I do think the Siren sums it up succinctly: "It's like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Saint Augustine</a> wrote the scripts."</p>
<p>Lance Mannion <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2009/08/all-the-mad-men-and-all-the-mad-women-cant-tell-a-joke-to-save-their-lives.html">goes further</a> and criticises the show's lack of humour. And while I think Pete is hilarious, he does have a point: "It's a comedy with all the jokes removed" and "Mad Men is one of the most relentlessly and deliberately humorless shows in the history of television drama".</p>
<p>(He is incorrect about none of the characters being musically inclined because we know Paul is a singer and that Joan can play the accordion - but she isn't an ad woman (but should be) - however, his blog post predates "My Old Kentucky Home".)</p>
<p>Well, I do like <em>Mad Men</em>, nay love it, but I can't help but thinking it would be even <em>better</em> if there was more <em>scherzando</em> like the scene when Pete and Trudy danced in every episode.</p>
