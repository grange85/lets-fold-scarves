  content: "Let me be the first to say thanks for a short but sweet commentary - It's
    always a treat to pop over to this site and find a new post, or response to one
    of my comments.\r\n\r\nI do remember the final fight: Buffy vs the group of Vamps
    as a good one.  The emotional jujitsu of the Buffy/Spike relationship entertained
    my wife and I - all the way to the end of the series.  \r\n\r\nI'm glad that you
    named the singer.  I wouldn't have known that was Aimee Mann - pretty cool (and
    I liked the Vampire town line...who else would know about what was really going
    on if not someone who travelled from town to town throughout the country.)\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, we'll be attending Dargon*con in Atlanta, GA in September.  My wife love
    James Marsters/Spike and we are going so that she can meet him.  She says
    that she doesn't know what to say to him or ask him.  Any suggestions from the
    crowd here?  The thought is, that there aren't many original things to say to
    someone like him.  Since he makes so many appearances and meets so many fans.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  content: "I like the episode and i liked this review.\r\n\r\nAs for the vampy knowledge
    - of course she knows! She's freakin' Aimee Mann!  \r\n\r\nMy only real problem
    with S7 from here on in is the lack of Ms Mann as the show could have used a laconic
    counterpoint and she has the best wardrobe by far.\r\n\r\nS7 - The Breeders, Kristin
    Hersh and Aimee Mann, really a nifty soundtrack."

    Aimee Mann is thoroughly cool. She has appeared in <em>Buffy</em> and likes comic books. And her music is pretty good too.

    If I was going to ask James Marsters a Spike related question, it probably would be a dull one like "what version of Spike (i.e. from what season) did you like playing best?"

    I certainly liked S4 Spike the best.

<p><strong>Sleeper</strong> (David Fury and Jane Espenson)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188" title="sleeper - the cast" src="/images/uploads/2009/07/sleeper-the-gang.jpg" alt="sleeper - the cast" width="534" height="300" /></p>
<p>I still like S7! And although I don't have much to say about this particular episode I still enjoyed it for the most part. It was Spike-centric and I simply don't have much to say about him or his relationship with Buffy.</p>
<p>I don't want to think too hard about this (I'll leave that to others) but isn't Buffy's attitude to Spike in "Sleeper" rather different from her attitude to Anya in "Selfless"?</p>
<p>The moment when Buffy/the First encourages Spike to kill is shocking.</p>
<p>I didn't like the way that Anya came onto Spike after he catches her snooping in his room. I realise that it is supposed to be funny and it is because Emma and James are good at being funny but it is tacky. And this: "I got it. No problem, I understand. You think I'm fat." is just idiotic and not funny at all (because I guess it was supposed to be ironic [insert twisted face smiley]).</p>
<p>Aimee Mann! Two songs and a line! OK, the line is annoying because she knows Sunnydale has vampires and it's not supposed to be common knowledge. But, Aimee Mann!</p>

<p>And it was nice to see Giles again albeit briefly.</p>
