  content: "Agreed.  Almost entirely.  I especially found it frustrating that Alpha
    turned out to have such bland and silly motivations.  The build-up had me imagining
    a character that would give some depth to the gray areas of the show.  Instead
    we got a stock megalomaniac who is obsessed over some girl.\r\n\r\nI don't know
    anything about Michelle Ryan except for appearance in Doctor Who, but I didn't
    particularly like her there."

  content: "while i agree with most of your views on the season per se, i have a different
    opinion on this episode, which, IMHO, rocked but fierce.\r\n\r\ni do enjoy reading
    your entries, \r\n(for Buffy and others as well) \r\n\r\nkeep 'em coming!"

<p><strong><em>Dollhouse</em> - "Omega"</strong> (Tim Minear)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1900" title="Dollhouse - Omega - Caroline in Wendy's body" src="/images/uploads/2009/05/omega-caroline-in-wendy.jpg" alt="Dollhouse - Omega - Caroline in Wendy's body" width="592" height="300" /></p>
<p>Whatever you say about <em>Dollhouse</em> (and I did) it was certainly different from the average TV show. I think it failed for approximately half the time. Some episodes were terrible. Others were amazing and "<a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/2009/04/17/maybe-therell-be-cakemaybe-therell-be-cake/">A Spy in the House of Love</a>&rdquo; was one of the best episodes that Joss Whedon has ever produced.</p>
<p>This was an episode chock full of exciting incidents and yet it still managed to be unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>(Poor <em>Dollhouse</em>. No other show I watch is burdened with such scrutiny because even my notes on <em>Buffy</em>, <em>Angel</em> and <em>Mad Men</em> are just reactions rather than criticism. Admittedly that is my style. I&rsquo;m not analytical enough to get into the substance of a show. That&rsquo;s what other people are for.)</p>

<p>I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performances which, as usual, were on the nose from my favourite cast members. The others were even okay. I think Eliza is perfectly serviceable as Echo. She wasn&rsquo;t outstanding but she was watchable enough which is fine when you aren&rsquo;t carrying the whole show on your shoulders. I think that is one of the reasons why <em>Bionic Woman</em> failed, as much as I like <a href="http://media.entertainment.sky.com/image/unscaled/2009/1/23/Feature-BBC-Doctor-Who-Easter-Special-Planet-Of-The-Dead-Michelle-Ryan-Jan09-Spoliers-16.jpg">Michelle Ryan</a>, she wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to carry the show (despite being the Bionic Woman, ha ha) and the supporting cast weren&rsquo;t strong or interesting enough either (maybe they should have promoted <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697062/">Molly Price</a> to joint lead).</li>
<li>The asking of the question of whether good and evil is innate or, if evolved, then indelible once it&rsquo;s in your personality (or soul or whatever).</li>
<li>The Topher and Whisky interactions near the end were mysterious and intriguing.</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like (and this list is longer):</p>
<ul>
<li>The abrupt escape of Alpha and the lack of November and Sierra as bounty hunters (*these important scenes were <a href="http://www.dollverse.com/2009/05/script-to-episode-12-omega.html">cut </a>for time).</li>
<li>The freedom granted to Madeleine. If she has been given back her original personality surely she is still grieving for her child? What was that closure she had back in &ldquo;Needs&rdquo;?&nbsp; Why was she dressed as a frump? I&rsquo;ll miss Miracle Laurie. I do wonder what she will get cast in next.</li>
<li>The eye gouging and the torture scene were too graphic for my taste and really rather unnecessarily lengthy.</li>
<li>Dr Saunders telling Victor he was ugly which is such nonsense and really hurtful.</li>
<li>The fight between Alpha and Echo wasn't exciting enough. Whatever else there is to say about Tahmoh Penikett, he knows how to fight.</li>
<li>Echo knocking off the "wedge" wasn't handled well. It just looked silly. Though Paul saving Caroline that way was hilarious.</li>
<li>The fact that the whole series revolved around the fact that Alpha thought Echo was hotter than Whiskey.</li>
<li>That Alpha was sinister at all times even when he was a doll (I do understand he was gaining self-awareness but he was <em>creepy</em> the whole time).</li><br />
</ul><br />

<p>I didn't mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul joining the Dollhouse because that may make no sense now but it will in the future. Won't it?</li>
<li>That we got no further information about Caroline's past. Something has to be saved for S2.</li><br />
</ul><br />
