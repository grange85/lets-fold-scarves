<p><strong>The Freshman</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>Buffy&rsquo;s disorientation was familiar and I remember that feeling that everybody knew each other or at least knew how to talk to other people except me who was lonely and useless. And, anybody I did know was far too busy making loads of new friends to bother with me. Moreover, I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t bother them because I needed to make new friends but everybody knew each other and I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;oh, god, it was awful, I hated every minute of it.</p>
<p>Erm, back to <em>BtVS</em>: it&rsquo;s odd how poor new season openers are, particularly since they are written by Joss Whedon. I like <em>Anne</em> but it&rsquo;s hardly a top ten episode and I hazard a guess that <em>When She Was Bad</em>, <em>Buffy vs Dracula</em> and <em>Bargaining</em> aren't anybody else&rsquo;s favourites either.</p>
<p>The episode is inconsistent. Buffy sustains injuries that suggest other forces at work not just a powerful vampire but nothing comes of it. Sunday was dispatched too soon; she would have made a great mini Big Bad. Buffy&rsquo;s offing of Sunday with a twirl of her stake is a classic moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal saviour?&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, you know I meant to and then I just got really busy.&rdquo; This is definitely a godless series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, this is great, you know, if we ever need a place for the Nuremberg rallies.&rdquo; This library shrinks considerably by <em>New Moon Rising</em>.</p>
<p>Oh hi Riley, how any episodes were you in before you got interesting?</p>
<p>Hi Maggie, your introduction says it all: &ldquo;I'm Professor Walsh. Those of you who fall under my good graces will come to know me as Maggie. Those of you who don't will come to know me by the name my TAs use, and think I don't know about, <strong>The Evil Bitch Monster of Death</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still feel like carrying around a security blanket.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Of Human Bondage</em>. Have you ever read it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I'm not really into porn...I mean I'm just...I'm trying to cut way back.&rdquo; Was Buffy given some of Xander's dialogue?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big score for Klimt! Monet still well in the lead, but look out for team Klimt, coming from behind.&rdquo; LOL</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffy, I've gone through some fairly dark times in my life, faced some scary things, among them the kitchen at the Fabulous Ladies Night Club. Let me tell you something, when it's dark and I'm all alone and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever, I always think, "What would Buffy do?" You're my hero. Ok, sometimes when it's dark and I'm all alone I think, "What is Buffy wearing?"&rdquo; &ldquo;Can that be one of those things you never, ever, tell me about?&rdquo; When Xander is giving a pep talk and I like what&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s saying, he&rsquo;s a real cutey.</p>
<p>Here's that IQ drop: Buffy knows Dadaist but then in the very next scene we get this exchange: &ldquo;You up for a little reconnaissance?&rdquo; &ldquo;You mean where we all sculpt and paint and stuff?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, that was the renaissance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's think this through.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can you be so calm?&rdquo; &ldquo;Long, arduous hours of practice.&rdquo;</p>
