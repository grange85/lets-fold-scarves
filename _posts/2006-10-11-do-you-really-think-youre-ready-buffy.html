    Now that's a good post after your lazy "bad eggs" review!
     "Fish of the day" doesn't work as well without the accompanying look on Buffy's face...

    <i>Now that&rsquo;s a good post after your lazy &ldquo;bad eggs&rdquo; review!</i>

    In Hazel's defense...Bad Eggs doesn't really have much to recommend it.

    I love the pre-date conversation between Oz and Willow more than I can say.

<p><strong>Surprise</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>From the ridiculous to the sublime (actually not quite the sublime, that&rsquo;s to come). <em>Surprise</em> is the slow build up to <em>Innocence</em> and it&rsquo;s a good episode in many ways: though that excludes the comedy strangling by severed arm</p>
<p><img id="image176" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/strangle.jpg" alt="strangle.jpg" /></p>
<p>and the Judge&rsquo;s name (that&rsquo;s because all I can think of is Rowan and Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://webpub.byu.net/rdh7/gv6/jokes/dajudge.htm">here comes da judge</a>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The tension between Buffy and Angel is palpable though my rational mind can&rsquo;t help thinking &ndash; he has no circulation, he&rsquo;ll be clammy, yuck &ndash; while my romantic mind is going ahhhh. The way they escape from Spike and Dru is a bit lame but gives them an excuse to get their clothes off and give Angel that &ldquo;one minute of happiness&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img id="image177" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/one%20minute.jpg" alt="one minute.jpg" /></p>
<p>Willow is continuing her remarkable cuteness curve despite:<br />
the big purple hat</p>
<p><img id="image172" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/Willow%20I%20said%20date.jpg" alt="Willow I said date.jpg" /></p>
<p>and the jumper with the Scottie dog</p>
<p><img id="image173" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/Willow%20Scottie.jpg" alt="Willow Scottie.jpg" /><br />
Her exchange with Oz is just adorable and the way she says &ldquo;I said 'date'&rdquo; is just wonderful. She has every right to be excited &ndash; Oz is so darn cool.</p>
<p>We discover that Jenny Calendar isn&rsquo;t Jenny Calendar but &ldquo;Janna, of the Kalderash people! A Gypsy!&rdquo; &ndash; oh boy, there&rsquo;s going to be trouble ahead &ndash; just what is she doing with Buffy and the Beetle? &ndash; it&rsquo;s all so suspicious. It&rsquo;s a pity Vincent Schiavelli hams this up a bit though the costume department wasn&rsquo;t doing him any favours with that hat (what is it with the hats??).</p>
<p><img id="image174" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/s%20hat.jpg" alt="s hat.jpg" /></p>
<p>Some random asides: Juliet Landau has incredible arms &ndash; all muscle and veins &ndash; I bet she has no problem giving blood. Buffy has a lot of rings on her fingers which reminds me of the incongruous collection on Abby Grant&rsquo;s fingers in <a href="http://www.survivorstvseries.com/index2.htm">Survivors</a>.</p>
<p><img id="image178" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/s%20rings.jpg" alt="s rings.jpg" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img id="image180" src="/images/uploads/2006/10/fish%20of%20the%20day.jpg" alt="fish of the day.jpg" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he's too old 'cause he's a senior? Please. My boyfriend had a bicentennial&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm gonna ask you to go out with me tomorrow night. And I'm kinda nervous about it, actually. It's interesting.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. Well, if it helps at all, I'm gonna say yes&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, it helps. It-it creates a comfort zone. Do you wanna go out with me tomorrow night?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! I can't!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, see, I like that you're unpredictable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it's hard to accept at first&rdquo;. &ldquo;Actually, it explains a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, it's sad, granted. But let's look at the upside for a moment. I mean, what kind of a future would she've really had with him? She's got two jobs - Denny's waitress by day, Slayer by night - and Angel's always in front of the TV with a big blood belly, and he's dreaming of the glory days when Buffy still thought this whole creature of the night routine was a big turn on.&rdquo; &ldquo;You've thought way too much about this.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no. That's just the beginning. Have I told you the part where I fly into town in my private jet and take Buffy out for prime rib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it again! Do it again!&rdquo;</p>
