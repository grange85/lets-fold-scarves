  content: 'Thanks Maureen. I really enjoy writing them. I know I have an audience
    of just two but that''s not why I do them. I love reliving the smashing dialogue
    through the transcripts available, looking up screencaps and other reviews, and
    just totally immersing myself in the Buffyverse. Once I finish this year''s Open
    University course (which will be this weekend) I''ll catch with the rest of season
    two and then on to season three: more Oz! and Anya!'

    I kind of like Beer Bad, but I wouldn't argue that it's anything other than a bad episode of Buffy.

    Bad Eggs was pretty lame, though.

    I've been rewatching Buffy from season 1 (the next episode up for me is Halloween), and I'm a little surprised that I'm enjoying different episodes this time around. I always sort of tossed aside season 1, but I found myself deeply moved by Prophecy Girl - I cried, actually.

    And I was really looking forward to School Hard, but I found James Marster's performance much more self-conscious this time. Although I give the character kudos for dusting the Annointed One.

    I enjoy these little recaps!

<p><strong>Bad Eggs</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>

<p>I am prepared to be contradicted once I rewatch Beer Bad but I think this is <em>the</em> worst episode of Buffy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even be bothered writing about it but it can be summarized as the Gorch Brothers, too much kissing, the unsubtle Aliens rip-off, and the overwrought music that merely emphasized that there was no drama on the screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. They say they'll call&rdquo; &ndash; even the dialogue is gyughh except this exchange: &ldquo;Can I just say gyughh!&rdquo; &ldquo;I see your 'gyughh!' and raise you a nyaghh!&rdquo;.</p>
