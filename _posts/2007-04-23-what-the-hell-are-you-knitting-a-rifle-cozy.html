  content: Laughing laughing laughing at the title. Have you got a link to this comic
    book? Sounds fun. I must admit I picked up a comic book for the first time ever
    a few weeks ago. Must have Buffy...

  content: This series has been on the go since September 2002 but it has been collected
    into various trade paperbacks starting with <i>Unmanned</i>. You can read
    the first issue at the Vertigo website. I have added that link to my original
    entry. Brian K. Vaughan reminds me of Joss Whedon and it's no co-incidence that
    BVK's <i>Runaways</i> is now being written by JW.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=1736">Y: The Last Man</a></strong> by <a href="http://">Brian K. Vaughan</a> and<a href="http://hellkitten.blogspot.com/"> Pia Guerra</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read up to #35 (the last part of <em>Girl on Girl</em>) and I admit it&rsquo;s been a fascinating if uneven ride. It almost lost me in <em>#3</em> when a bunch of squabbling female politicians are shown their place by a man but I&rsquo;m glad I persisted. BVK is an excellent writer and he tells a story very cleanly. Pia Guerra&rsquo;s artwork matches this but I look more Oriental than Dr Mann. <em>#3</em> also has a blip when President Valentine&rsquo;s blouse gains a collar and she gets a new hairdo over a couple of pages. I was mouthing wtf when I started reading <em>Safeword</em> but BVK excelled himself with its denouement.</p>
<p>However, some of the covers have been extraordinarily naff. There is no way I would have bought issues <em>#2</em>, <em>#28</em>, <em>#29</em>, <em>#32</em> and <em>#33</em> based on those covers. I&rsquo;ll forgive #2 because she was a supermodel with I&rsquo;m guessing at modified tits but the others (by Massimo Carnevale) are just maddingly sexist. <em>#31</em> has Toyota with what I shall christen porn tongue while the depiction of Dr Mann and 355 on <em>#33</em> is just pandering to anyone whose <em>ears</em> pricked up when they read the title <em>Girl on Girl</em>.</p>
