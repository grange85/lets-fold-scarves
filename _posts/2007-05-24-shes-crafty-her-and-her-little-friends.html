    The worst, absolute worst episode weather-wise is Amends, when everyone is complaining about how hot it is while they are wearing coats and hats.

    I think it gets quite cool in CA at night - southern CA is a desert, so I think it has similar heating/cooling patterns. They probably shot at the wee hours of the morning, which might account for all the sweaters.

    As usual, you make many good points. So I'll just pick one to comment on. Seriously, how cold is it? I've been wondering that since season one. What is with the big fat hairy sweaters and the teeny strapless tops, often in the same scene? But as I've only been to CA once, I guess I cannot judge.
    OK, well, one more comment. Agreed - ASH hilarious drunk. Just want to take him home. That man could seriously turn me straight :)

  content: "As for the contradiction of skimpy versus sweaters:\r\n- I lived in Southern
    California and the deal is in the winter it can go down to the 30s at night.  But
    if you want to look good, you wear whatever and hope to get indoors as soon as
    possible.\r\n\r\n- I bought the warmest coat that I ever owned in California to
    help in the cold desert nights."

  content: Thanks <strong>dman</strong> for your comment. I guess to me in temperate
    London it just seems strange to see the seeming contradictions in the costumes.
    On the other hand, there are men who watch football matches over here in winter
    bare-chested...

<p><strong>The Yoko Factor</strong> (Doug Petrie)</p>
<p>Riley says that Buffy told him this about Angel: &ldquo;Everything. More than I wanted to know sometimes. She loved him. He turned evil. He, uh, killed people. She cured him. He left. Interesting little curse.&rdquo; and then when Xander mentions &ldquo;One moment's happiness.&rdquo; he gets upset. Therefore that means that Riley is more upset about the sex than the love...which is bonkers.</p>
<p>Spike&rsquo;s work on the Scoobies is very clever but the position they have got themselves into over the season has helped a great deal. Buffy not wanting to talk about Angel is annoying but reasonable behaviour for her in season four.</p>
<p>What is Doug Petrie on? First the Riley misplaced jealously and now Willow wanting to study drama? Hello, <em>Nightmares</em>?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Forrest but this is pretty accurate: &ldquo;Such a big head on that skinny little body.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="imagebox-left"><img id="image528" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/yoko-whiz.jpg" alt="Willow is a whizz in The Yoko Factor" /><br/>&ldquo;I am a whiz.&rdquo; &ldquo;She is a whiz.&rdquo; &ldquo;If ever a whiz there was.&rdquo;</div><br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Of course Willow (&ldquo;I knew Buffy was freaked.&rdquo;) ignores the wise advice from Tara &ldquo;You should talk to her, cause I'm sure she&hellip;&rdquo; in favour of presuming the worst. (Aside: Buffy et al, actually take Willow&rsquo;s outing very well, much better than you would expect from people who had little clue that she may be gay and much better than many fans of the show.)</p>
<p>The scene in Buffy&rsquo;s dorm room between Riley, Angel and Buffy is funny and very well played by the trio.</p>
<p>Adam in funny moment: &ldquo;Don't tell me you've never heard of the Beatles?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have. I like <em>Helter Skelter</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="imagebox-left"><img id="image527" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/yoko-tile.jpg" alt="Tara and Anya in the bathroom in The Yoko Factor" /><br/>"Like the tile." A lovely moment between the two outsiders.</div><br clear="all"/></p>
<div class="imagebox-left"><img id="image526" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/yoko-giles.jpg" alt="Giles is drunk in The Yoko Factor" /><br/>"Bloody hell!" Giles (or should I say ASH) makes a great drunk.</div><br clear="all"/></p>
<p>"So...I guess I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One...and her friends." The yelling and fighting is almost funny except that it's too sad and close to the bone.</p>
<p>This episode ends on a cliffhanger and has a definite air of being incomplete in all other ways too (issues that are a bit too easily glossed over in the next of the series). And I still need to know just how cold are the evenings in SoCal?<br />
