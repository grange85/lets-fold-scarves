The kissing scenes between James Stewart and Grace Kelly make my toes curl. He is old enough to be her dad and looks like it too. Also he's James Stewart who I have a hard time liking.

However, what a fab film this is. The last twenty minutes are very exciting and tense. The dialogue around what Lars Thorvald is up to is funny and snappy. Thelma Ritter is splendid (as usual). I love the individual stories that make up the apartments around the courtyard really enrich the film. It's a lot of fun and really is one of Hitchcock's best.
