stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.</blockquote></p>
<p>                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar. in <em>Following the Equator</em> by Mark Twain (1897)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this film starring one of my favourite people, Emma Thompson. Great music, fascinating story, good cast and lots of baked goods. I would have happily been one of Ana's study buddies.</p>
<p>Best line "I brought you flours."</p>
