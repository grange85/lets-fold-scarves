<p><em>The Guardian</em>'s blogging editorial policy seems determined to be as divisive as possible regarding gender. <em>The Guardian</em> used to be one of my quick links but recently I removed it because I was fed up with being sucked into a Comment is Free blog full of mutual hatred just because I was looking for some news to read. I still have their arts blogs feeds set up in Netvibes because they are interesting. However, <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/01/can_a_woman_pilot_a_war_novel.html">this piece</a> by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs_20060122.shtml">John Sutherland</a> is mind-bogglingly stupid. He asks whether women can write about war by going on about joysticks and shrivelling balls when he hears a woman's voice coming from a cockpit and, without irony, uses an article by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Buchanan#Feminism">Pat Buchanan</a> to illustrate a point. (Hang on, maybe, the <em>whole thing</em> is ironic! And maybe it's <em>meant</em> to be funny!) It is painful to read because of sentences like this </p>
<blockquote><p>Can a class of writer so institutionally and historically disengaged from a subject write a classic (or even a good) novel on it?</blockquote></p>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Why, with all those "women's subjects" at her disposal, did Kennedy venture into this most exclusive of manly enclaves?</blockquote></p>
<p>I shall certainly read <em>Can Jane Eyre Be Happy?</em> and <em>Is Heathcliff a Murderer?</em> in a different light now.</p>
<p>But still, a good thing has come out of it - I actually quite fancy reading <em>Day</em> by AL Kennedy now.</p>
<p>PS Even it is written in humour this type of article is all over <em>The Guardian</em> these days and they <em>are</em> serious.</p>
