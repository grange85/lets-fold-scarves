    An empty Director's Reel: shove your Ostentatiously-Long Tracking Shot and your Essentially Pointless Fight Scene and tell a story, Joss.  And the pacing is screwed up, with Act 4 so bloated.

    And why isn't Giles helping the kids out?  In S2 he was very clear that if Buffy wasn't up to patrol, it was *his* responsibility. (See "Ted" or "BB&amp;B".)  Now he just casually sends Willow and Xander out to patrol, where they're getting beat by the vampires half the time. Ugh.

    Oz flunking also blows. It's against his established academic record, Willow's non-reaction is against her character, and it wastes an opportunity to better establish the local college in the viewers' minds before B/W/X go there next year.  Oz can still Scooby in his off-hours, all you'd lose is Oz in Sunnydale High classroom scenes, and he was never in even one of those.  (Although he did attend the self-defense lecture in the gym in "Phases".)  Waste of a premiere episode, IMO.

<p>I love everything Buffy-related in this episode. The stuff with the other Scoobies was irritating: why didn&#39;t just tell Cordelia that Xander missed her? The tiny scene between Joyce and Giles was deliciously fraught: that woman should be rightfully furious.<br></p>
<p><br>I love what happens to Buffy over the course of the programme: she can&#39;t help but do the right thing and when she she does it is magnificent: starting with the offhand reply to the nurse&#39;s question&nbsp; ("Breaking into your office and going through your private files") to wielding that hunga munga in one the best fight sequences so far in <i>Buffy</i>.<br></p>
<p><br>However, it is Sister Sunshine/Chanterelle/Lily/Anne who makes me tearful. She is so pathetic but there are glimmers of inner strength notably when she pushes Ken-demon off the ledge and knowing she later administrates a shelter for the homeless (in <i>Angel</i>) it is good to see just how much good Buffy does despite her mistakes.<br></p>
