  content: While watching Such is the Law at the British Silent Film Festival, I noticed
    a female lawyer on the barristers' bench. Such is the Law was an early sound film
    which sandwiched a silent film between sound bookends. An interesting experiment.

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this. I have always liked Herbert Marshall. I find him immensely charming and he was perfectly cast in this.</p>

<p>The final sequence was heavily influenced by German cinema and who doesn&rsquo;t love a trapeze artist coming on for his act dressed as a woman?</p>

<p>Hitchcock's films are full of humour. I think he is a bit underrated in that respect. There is nearly always a laugh in one of his films except maybe <em>The Wrong Man</em>.</p>
<p>One really notable thing about the film was that it featured a female barrister. A real one was called to the bar in 1922 but I think that I can safely say I have never seen one on film ever. I mean there was <em>This Life</em> on the telly but on film before that? Can anybody point me to another example?</p>
