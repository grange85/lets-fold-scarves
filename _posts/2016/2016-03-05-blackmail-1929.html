<p>I watched the sound version and the silent version ages ago and enjoyed them both. I preferred Anny Ondra when she was silent because the dubbing is all wrong. Joan Barry was far too posh. The knife scene works well both ways but I have to say the sound version is very clever. Hitchcock has turned into Hitchcock.</p>

<p>I love the glimpses of London in the twenties we get particularly those seen during Alice's walk of misery after the murder.</p>
