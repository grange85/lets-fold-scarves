Earlier in the year, Andy and I decided to visit every station on the Underground (at least in passing). Andy took it upon himself to take the photographs of the stations (usually the roundel except where a station doesn't have any) and I took it upon myself to look out the window. Here we are at Edgware station, the final one, and we are looking thrilled. We look like this because I'm terrible at framing these sorts of photos.</p>
