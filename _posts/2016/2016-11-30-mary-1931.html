<p>I'm not sure I can give this a fair crack of the whip. We watched the first half in German with French subtitles until I decided that that neither my French or German was making much headway (despite having seen the English language version) so we watched the rest on YouTube with English subtitles.</p>
<p>It was okay. Not as much fun as the original. There's no kitten in bed for starters.</p>

<p>Edit: I can see the version I linked to above has been removed. That was good timing on our part and a shame because I don't know where you can see an English language subtitled version.</p>
