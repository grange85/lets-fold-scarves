<div style="text-align: center;"><img title="l17626595139_6764.jpg" alt="l17626595139_6764.jpg" src="http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/resize/index/id/581/w/629/h/354/site_45_rand_1463609969_redman.jpg"><br></div><br><a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/amanda-redmans-scars/" target="_blank">This article</a> about Amanda Redman over at the Hathor Legacy made me realise just how good we have it on British TV in some ways; how we do have a fine variety of individual and, dare I say, normal looking women on our screens at all time. I watched the first few episodes of <i>Parenthood</i> and all the women are slender with no imperfections (not even glasses) and, sadly, Bonnie Bedelia doesn&#39;t look her age (though, actually, she does look her age...), and that is symptomatic of all US series. <br></p>
<p> <br>The casting of Miracle Laurie in <i>Dollhouse</i> was a miracle and yet over here we had the two successive leading women in <i>Jonathan Creek</i> and neither of them, Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha, would get leading roles on US TV because they are both overweight. <br></p>
<p> <br>Would Denise Black with her deformed hand get the same number of prominent roles in the States? <br><br>Our soaps are full of fabulous women of all shapes and sizes with women who look their age but it&#39;s not perfect in GB TV land because outside drama and comedy, older and fatter women are invisible. The current tribunal involving Miriam O&#39;Reilly and <i>Countryfile</i> is a perfect example of this. Along with Charlotte Smith or Juliet Morris, there was no way these middle aged woman was going to be on prime time TV. Obviously, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/nov/08/miriam-oreilly-bbc-countryfile" target="_blank">if a show needs a shake up</a> you&#39;re not going to get rid of the fascinating blokes like John Craven and Adam Henson, are you?&nbsp; <br></p>
