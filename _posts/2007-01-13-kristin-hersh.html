<p>I think last night (well, the night before and she did), Kristin Hersh broke a guitar string while entertaining the heck out of me. I wonder how she doesn't break a vocal cord. Her voice is a plaintive sad thing one second and a rasping hair-raiser the next. She was on awesome form, <em><a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/kristin.htm#a">Your Ghost</a></em> made me cry, and the <a href="http://www.houseofmccarrick.com/home/">McCarricks</a> were the icing on the cake because the <em>Strings EP</em> is just wonderful.<br /><br />

Many years ago, I stood at the ts in Virgin on the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road and fingered <em>Hunkpapa</em> and dared myself to buy it because I had heard <em>Dizzy</em> on the radio: I didn't and I feel quite bad about that. And how I would have impressed <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/01/12/kristin-hersh-the-arts-theatre-london/">Andy</a> if I had had.</p></p>
