    I kind of love Willow, in response to Anya saying she needs her necklace back, saying: "have you tried looking in the sofa cushions...in HELL?!?"

    I also like Anya's frustration at the beginning of the episode when she complains about being a mortal, stuck in high school, "and I'm failing math!"

<p><strong>The Wish</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite episodes of <em>BtVS</em> and I consider it so highly that I forgive Marti Noxon for both <em>Bad Eggs</em> and <em>Dead Man's Party</em>. For just now, anyway.</p>
<p>Setting a story in an alternative universe, means you can do what you like to the characters (within plausibility) without any long-term repercussions. It is a concept that can only work when we have come to understand the characters and care about what happens to them even in this alternative universe. Contrast this with <em>The Zeppo</em> where it seemed that they were all in an alternative universe but the writers forgot to tell us.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image318" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/wish.jpg" alt="The end of the Wish" /></div>I&rsquo;m not going to go on about this episode because I&rsquo;ll just become incoherent. Suffice to say that the death of Cordelia with an anguished Giles looking helplessly on is only surpassed in this episode by the breaking of Buffy&rsquo;s neck by the Master. The way she lifelessly sways and drops is more of a gut-wrencher than her real death in <em>The Gift</em>. <br clear="all"/><br />
<img id="image316" src="/images/uploads/2007/01/the-death-of-cordelia.jpg" class="left" alt="The death of Cordelia" />Xander and Willow killing Cordelia is powerful and shocking. There is something perverse about Xander pulling Willow further towards Cordelia&rsquo;s neck.<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>Anya seems to perk up at the notion that Xander is marginally cooler just before Cordelia makes her fateful wish.</p>
<p>There are two clunky bits of dialogue which written down don&rsquo;t seem so bad but maybe Nick Brendon&rsquo;s teeth made it difficult for him to deliver them well: "You love all the parts." and "We really are living in a golden age."</p>
<p>Dialogue to relish:</p>
<p>"Look, I'm sorry this is hard for you. But I told you what I need. So, I can't help feeling like the reason you want to talk is so you can feel better about yourself. That's not my problem."  - the way <a href="http://www.sethgreenonline.com/">Seth Green</a> as Oz delivers this makes it seem much less harsh and makes Oz seem like the wisest teenager ever.</p>
<p>"That didn't work. Who wants chocolate?"</p>
<div class="imagebox-left"><img id="image319" src="/images/uploads/2007/02/anya.jpg" alt="Anya in The Wish" /><br/>"Still, I mean... Don't you kinda wish...?"</div><br clear="all"/></p>
<p>"<a href="http://dogwood.phpwebhosting.com/~tvshrine/buffy/b-wbored.wav">Bored now</a>"</p>
<p>"Hmm. Buffy. Ooo. Scary." "Someone has to talk to her people. That name is striking fear in nobody's hearts."</p>
<p>"Why don't I just put a stake through her heart?" "She's not a vampire." "Mm, well, you'd be surprised how many things that'll kill." - Buffy is extremely Faith like in this episode...</p>
<p>"World is what it is. We fight. We die. Wishing doesn't change that." "I have to believe in a better world." "Go ahead. I have to live in this one."</p>
