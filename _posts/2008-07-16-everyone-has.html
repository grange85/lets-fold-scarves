<p>On Monday's ten o'clock news there was an item on Max Mosley and how his libel case against the <em>NOTW</em> has been brought under <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art8">article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> and its statement regarding privacy which reads</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</blockquote><br />
I certainly hope they reword it soon because, as it stands, I, and approximately half of the English speaking members of the Council of Europe, appear to have no human rights.</p>
