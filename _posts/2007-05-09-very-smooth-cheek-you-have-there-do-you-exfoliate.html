  content: My friend that I've been watching these with suggested this as perhaps
    the worst (pre-season 6) episode.  I disagree, though I see where he's coming
    from.  But you picked out almost every one of the moments that make it worthwhile.  Especially
    the Spike Danger Mouse speech.

<p><strong>Where the Wild Things Are</strong> (Tracey Forbes)</p>
<p>This is the other candidate from season four for the least liked episode. <img id="image502" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/wtwta-giles.jpg" class="left" alt="Where the Wild Things Are - Giles singing" />And like <em>Beer Bad</em> I can defend it or, at least, list good things about it. For one thing, the Buffy and Riley having sex scenes don&rsquo;t take up that much screen time (though they do seem endless). And surely an episode with Giles singing can&rsquo;t be a total wash-out? By the way, Giles singing isn&rsquo;t actually a good thing but it was a great <em>BtVS</em> moment (&ldquo;Um, could we go back to the haunted house? Cause, this is creeping me out.&rdquo;)<br clear="all"/></p>
<p>There is a lot of excellent character interaction between Xander and Anya, Anya and Spike, and Tara and Willow. In fact, reviewing this episode was more fun than doing <em>Superstar</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anya and Xander argue in front of children and parents: &ldquo;You want sex? Let's have sex. Right here. Hot, sweaty, big sex.&rdquo; (OK, question, why is the ice cream van a right hand drive? Are all ice cream vans right hand drives in the US?)</li>

<li>&ldquo;They, they're probably going to&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, thank you Willow, I did attend university in the Mesozoic era, I do remember what it's like.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anya and Spike begin their relationship with a funny scene: &ldquo;What are you doing? You made me yell really high.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;Hey, Buffy, this might be a good time to mention that someone, so not me, spilled something purpley on your new peasant top which I would never borrow without asking. Still love me?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You should ride with me sometime. I guarantee safety and fun.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...if you promise you'll look after me.&rdquo; (Subtle)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Anya, this is crazy. We had a little fight. It just means that we have to work our way through some stuff. It doesn't mean that we rebound with the evil undead.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d almost feel sorry for Xander except it&rsquo;s his fault she does rebound.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;I know I'm not the first choice for heroics...and Buffy's tried to kill me more than once. And, I don't fancy a single one of you at all. But...actually, all that sounds pretty convincing. I wonder if Danger Mouse is on.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Xander is very brave by at least trying to help his friends.</li>
<li>&ldquo;No. They're probably dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Unless they're too busy doing it to answer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; &ldquo;You know, for a god of acoustic rock, you're...kind of naive.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn't think you meant ...in the midst of all that, do you really think they were keeping it up? Oh, for a different phrasing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, see, that's the thing. People all over the party were starting to act&hellip;weird. Sexually.&rdquo; &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; &ldquo;You know&hellip;ways.&rdquo; (Subtext alert!)</li><br />

<li>Mrs Holt being a child abuser wasn&rsquo;t a surprise but it&rsquo;s was nice to see <a href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/landingham.html">Mrs Landingham</a> being evil.</li>
<li> &ldquo;What do you feel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sad, afraid of being without you, and a little hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;I meant about the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. Still haunted.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We're just lucky no one got injured.&rdquo; (Er, what about that thorn through Anya&rsquo;s hand and that scratch on Xander's face?)</li>
