<p>Judy Davis is one of my favourite actors and has been ever since <em>My Brilliant Career</em>. She exudes intelligence and poise.</p>
<p>Her best performances include <em>A Passage to India</em>, <em>High Tide</em>, <em>Impromptu</em>, <em>Barton Fink</em> and <em>Life With Judy Garland</em>.</p>
<p>This picture was taken outside court during a recent libel case so I guess she is under stress but I think she looks splendiferous.</p>
