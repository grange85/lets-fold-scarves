<p>I love these lyrics and coupled with <a href="http://www.kathrynwilliams.co.uk/">Kathryn Williams</a>'s delicate vocals, the effect is gorgeous.</p>
<div align="center"><strong>Old Low Light #2</strong></p>
<p>In a room banging on about the world in words<br />
There's an old low light it flicks on and off<br />
Like our opinions<br />
Three hours without a word<br />
Then you stroke my arm<br />
There's an old low light in me<br />
And it switches on</p>
<p>It's not visible to anyone but our love lives there<br />
I can feel it shimmer<br />
It's old and quiet and it stares out like years</p>
<p>In a different city bed in my sister's house<br />
There's an old low light it keeps me awake<br />
Without the shape of you<br />
Track four on a CD you made for me<br />
There's a note like light and it changes the air<br />
And it makes me love you more<br />
It makes me love you more<br />
More, more, more, more</p>
<p>It's not visible to anyone but our love lives there<br />
I can feel it glimmer<br />
It's old and quiet and stares out like you<br />
And it makes me love you more<br />
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more</p>
<p>You're my old low light<br />
And I love you more<br />
repeat</div></p>
