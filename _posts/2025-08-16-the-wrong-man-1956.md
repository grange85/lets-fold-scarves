The Wrong Man is is an excellent film but so so different from the usual fare from Hitchcock. 

Henry Fonda really inhabits the role of an ordinary man which is impressive for a film star of twenty years standing. The domestic scenes are particularly sweet. The chilling matter of fact style of the film as Manny is arrested, interviewed, and locked up is really effective. 

The scene between father and son is really beautifully written and performed:

<blockquote>
Hope you never have to go through anything like I did. If you ever do, I hope you've got a son just like mine to come back to. I never knew what my boys meant to me till right now.
</blockquote>

Vera Miles' descent into despair is really well done in that you can see how injustice can wear down the mental health of a well adjusted person.
