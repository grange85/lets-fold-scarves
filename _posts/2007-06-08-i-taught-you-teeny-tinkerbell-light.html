<p><strong>Out of My Mind</strong> (<a href="http://www.btvs-tabularasa.net/list/rrk.html">Rebecca Rand Kirshner</a>)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image572" src="/images/uploads/2007/06/ooom-tara.jpg" alt="Out of My Mind - Tara - Willow hand - any old excuse" /></div>Uh oh, a sign that Tara won&rsquo;t be one of the dynamic characters in the future:  &ldquo;I just keep thinking how cool it would be, if we got a real psychic to sit up here and read fortunes and stuff.&rdquo; &ldquo;You should do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not me. But, but I'd love to, to watch and learn. From someone who's really good, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harmony in small doses is funny: &ldquo;Taking up smoking, are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am a villain, Spike, hellooooo.&rdquo; (she starts coughing) but later in the episode I&rsquo;m all &ldquo;<em>please</em> make it stop, now&rdquo;. The scenes in the college operating theatre (or whatever the hell it is) are just stupid and annoying and let&rsquo;s face it, totally implausible (Spike even moves his head at one time) and Harmony&rsquo;s smoking is just not funny: entirely lame scenes.</p>
<p>Joyce faints: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;

<p>I&rsquo;m not happy with the way Buffy and Riley&rsquo;s relationship is going because I get the vibe (and we get hit over the head with it eventually) that it&rsquo;s all Buffy&rsquo;s fault. She&rsquo;s apparently unreachable, untouchable and doesn&rsquo;t love him. He can&rsquo;t deal with that so what is she supposed to do? Run after him? (I do concede that maybe she shouldn&rsquo;t have left him quite so soon after his life saving operation).</p>
<p>Spike could leave Sunnydale to get the Slayer out of his hair but he can&rsquo;t do that when he&rsquo;s in the title credits.</p>
<p>But, despite the general ineptitude of this episode (including the embarrassing conversation that Willow and Buffy have at the beginning) it has a jaw dropping ending: &ldquo;Oh, god, no. Please, no.&rdquo;</p>
