I have just finished <em>Strangers in Paradise</em> Pocket Books 2 and 3. They sat on a shelf for several weeks until I was ready to read them and I devoured them in two days. They are utterly compelling if a teeny-tiny tad far-fetched. I find it interesting that people who love the books don't mention the Big Six but just talk about the triangle between Katchoo, Francine and David because that <em>is</em> what matters and makes these books such exciting, exhilarating and funny page turners. If I must complain then Francine is Hollywood fat like Renee Zellweger in <em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em> i.e. <a href="http://windowmanager.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/renee_zellweger-726260.jpg">not</a>.</p>

<p>I have also read <em>Persepolis </em>by <a href="http://www.asiasource.org/news/special_reports/satrapi.cfm">Marjane</a> <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/int/2005/04/24/satrapi/index.html?pn=1">Satrapi </a>which follows the mid-childhood of a  girl at the time of the Iranian Revolution. The style is very simple but highly expressive which is not easy when nearly everyone is either dark-haired or wearing a <a href="http://www.thehijabshop.com/information/how_to_wear.php">head scarf</a>. The final panel is heartbreaking.<br />
Many reviews compare it with <em><a href="http://www.geocities.com/athens/Atlantis/2671/">Maus</a></em> which I think is a bit lazy because it implies that<em> Maus</em> is the only political graphic novel the reviewers have read (or heard of...) which is probably true because it is the only one I had read until Will Eisner's <em>The Plot</em>. Anyway, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/arnold/article/0,9565,452401,00.html">here</a> is one that doesn't.</p>
