    this is a favourite for many reasons some of them being the fabulous acting, brilliant music and genuine emotions, particularly seen in the interaction between O/T, O/W and W/T. none of the 3 main here are bad but someone had to get hurt.

    SMG is great in her dialogue delivery in the dorm scene.
    we dont generally feel for her (being slayer &#38;#38; all), shes still the glue that holds the series and the scoobies together. great actress playes a range of emotions very well.

  content: <b>Charles</b>, thank you for your comment. Just to clarify, I don't
    have a general problem with Tara's stammer and what it signifies when she does
    stutter but it is just in this episode and, in particular, the "Do what makes
    you happy" scene that it sounds (to my ears) forced and unnatural. I <i>adore</i>
    Amber Benson and her portrayal of Tara as you will see if you stick around...

    Just discovered this - very nice and I will have to explore.

    This is one of my absolute favorite episodes in part because Tara is my favorite character and this is when she is happiest and at her very best, but also because I think it's a tremendously acted episode.

    One disagreement: the stutter is one of the (if not the single most) endearing things about Tara.  I don't know if it was supposed to be part of the character or was just an inspired moment from Amber Benson, but it is brilliant.  She doesn't overdo it, and it's a strong sign throughout the seasons that she is seriously stressed out or feeling left out.

    I never fail to cry at the end of this episode.

    Nothing on the scale of what you're doing here, but I just posted my thoughts after finishing the series a couple nights ago <a href="http://heartachewithhardwork.blogspot.com/2007/08/its-all-long-goodbyes.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you're interested.

    one thing i disagree with:
    in the van scene, oz tells willow "I mean, it turns out...
    the one thing that brings it out in me is you... which falls under the heading of ironic in my book.

    didn't he turn into wolfie at the initiative when exposed to external negative stimuli?

    gee thats not fair to willow is it?

  content: just watched the episode tonight, and the scenes between t/w "still
    be your friend" and w/o "nows not that time" still bring a tear to my eye.
    the music isin't helping either.

    Different strokes, I suppose.  I re-watched this episode a couple nights ago and it only killed me even more.  I can see how it might sound unnatural for someone else, but for me it's the most perfect instance of the stutter.  Except maybe when it comes out of hiding in season 5 in times of great stress.

    Also, I had forgotten how much I really do love Oz.  Before Tara, he might very well have been my favorite character and the scene in the van is really touching, especially in contrast to the scene way back in Innocence when Willow asks him if he wants to make out.  They've both come so far...

    Hi Goya,

    The dialogue in the van doesn't really make sense (not to me anyway) which is one of the reasons why I think this is a poorly thought out episode. I like parts of it a lot (anything with Tara) but the rest is confused.

<p><strong>New Moon Rising</strong> (Marti Noxon)</p>
<p>I have seen some scenes many, many times but overall too much of this episode is poorly thought out and developed.</p>
<p>Oz can&rsquo;t control the wolf when he&rsquo;s affected by strong emotions like jealousy or pain and so even if Willow had decided that she wanted to be with him that couldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>However, even if you didn&rsquo;t know Seth Green had decided to leave the series the evidence is there in the episode that Willow would choose Tara. There is no woo or hoo because despite it being Oz (you know) she is not thrilled about his return which is why she chooses waffles and whatever happens during the cardigan swapping scene makes Oz&rsquo;s nose tingle.</p>
<p>The acting in this episode is tremendous: we expect the best from Alyson Hannigan and Seth Green but Amber Benson is wonderfully touching (stutter notwithstanding). The scene between Oz and Tara is tense and exciting and you can feel their individual pain acutely and I love that even in his anguish he warns her to run.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image519" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/new-moon-rising-run.jpg" alt="New Moon Rising - Oz says run to Tara" /></div></p>
<p>My version of the Tara and Willow story is that Tara is totally smitten with Willow as soon as she sees her: it is love at first sight. In fact, Tara actively pursues Willow and is rather forward when she tells her she is special in <em>Hush</em>. Consequently, what she does in <em>New Moon Rising</em> is self-sacrificial and brave (she even says she wants to be Willow&rsquo;s friend no matter what) and noble.</p>
<p>I understand there are some people who think the opening scene is a bit cute and sick-making but I think it's so sweet. And they hold hands!</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image516" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/new-moon-rising-hands.jpg" alt="New Moon Rising - Willow and Tara hold hands" /></div></p>
<p>"I'm overhelping, aren't I?" I do regret not calling this blog <em>overhelping</em> but I can't change it now because a search on Google with the keywords <em>let's fold scarves</em> brings up his site <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>More snark between Anya and Giles and then Oz turns up: "Oz" breathes Tara as the happiness swooshes out of her body.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image518" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/new-moon-rising-no-new-guy.jpg" alt="New Moon Rising - Willow says no new guy" /></div><br />
Willow is a witch and interested in Wicca and there is <em>no way</em> she wouldn't have realised it was a full moon. Alyson Hannigan is very, very good: listen and watch as she says "No. No new... guy." And oo, a green choker alert.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image514" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/new-moon-rising-buffy-gets-a-clue.jpg" alt="New Moon Rising - Buffy gets a clue" /></div><br />
The scene between Willow and Buffy when Will comes out is superb: just perfectly written and acted:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Okay, I'm all with the woo-hoo here, and you're not." "No, there's "woo" and, and "hoo." But there's "uh-oh," and..."why now?" And...it's complicated." "Why complicated?" "It's complicated...because of Tara." "You mean Tara has a crush on Oz? No...Oh! Oh. Um...well...that's great. You know, I mean, I think Tara's a, a really great girl, Will." "She is. And...there's something between us. It-it wasn't something I was looking for. It's just powerful. And it's totally different from what Oz and I have." </blockquote></p>
<p>Apparently, other stuff does actually happen in this episode like Riley quits the Initiative and Buffy steels herself to actually tell him about her relationship with Angel ("an unconventional relationship", indeed).</p>
<p>And Oz leaves:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image517" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/s-oz.jpg" alt="New Moon Rising - Oz" /></div></p>
<p>And this is now it ends and it is adorable:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"No candles? Well, I brought one. It's extra flamey...Tara, I have to tell you..." "No, I-I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love." "I am." "You mean...?" "I mean. Okay?" "Oh, yes." "I feel horrible about everything I put you through. A-and I'm gonna make it up to you. Starting right now." "Right now?"</blockquote></p>
