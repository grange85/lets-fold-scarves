<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I wish I was better at writing about music. I don&rsquo;t think I can adequately express myself mainly because as much as love music I essentially have cloth ears. Although, recently I did do a University of Newcastle survey which showed that 21 times out of 25 (actually it was 25 times out of 30) I could tell the difference between similar tunes: this surprised me.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">My first reaction is always to the overall sound that I hear then I pay attention to the instrumentation and the lyrics last. So unless the lyrics are spectacularly crass or dull then good lyrics are the icing on the cake.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><em>Save Me</em> by <a href="http://www.aimeemann.com/home.html">Aimee Mann</a> is such a song. Aimee&rsquo;s vocals are strong, the tune melodic and catchy and to cap it all the lyrics are "At Seventeen" ("</font>to those of us who know the pain of valentines that never came") <font size="2" face="Verdana">revisited: "save me&hellip;from the ranks of the freaks who suspect they could never love anyone".</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><em>Ghost World</em> is another fine song which captures the essence of the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0224060880/qid=1141253328/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/026-9219469-1126820">comic </a>(graphic novel) and the <a href="http://www.ghostworld-the-movie.com/ns/index.html">film</a> (but, why bother with them? the song is so good):"I'm bailing this town</font> <font size="2" face="Tahoma">&ndash;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or tearing it down</font> <font size="2" face="Tahoma">&ndash;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or probably more like hanging around".</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With <a href="http://www.paulafrazer.com/">Paula Frazer </a>and Tarnation, the lyrics are definitely secondary (tertiary actually). Her voice and the arrangements are awesome and often moving.<br />
