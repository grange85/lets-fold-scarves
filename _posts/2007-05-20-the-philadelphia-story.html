    filter - I remember thinking this movie was great when I saw it as a kid.

  content: I saw the film last night for the first time in 30 years. I hurt for the
    Tracy Lord character - alienated, no female friends, desperate to be masculine
    and please the men who betray her.  A bummer film with an unhealthy message.  Should
    be avoided.

  content: I love old films but <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> particularly rankles
    (I think because it is considered a classic) but not nearly as much as <i>My Favorite
    Wife</i> and definitely not as much as <i>Pretty Woman</i>...

  content: "This is rather a late comment, but I've seen this film several times and
    watched it again today. Each time I have raised my eyebrows at the slant of the
    sexual politics within and, seeing as I had never heard others comment on this
    aspect of the film I searched for it on Google and this was what came up.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a shame really as the film has some great comic moments, with the post-party scenes
    being particularly amusing. I was very surprised at the final outcome of the movie.
    As Connor was the only character who treated Tracy as an equal I had expected
    them to get together. I also found the fact that Tracy's father blamed her for
    his affair a bit shocking and a rather weak excuse for his behaviour. 22 year
    old male, by the way."

    Hi Will,

    I'm glad you found this post. I am dismayed by the sexual politics in the film (obviously) but also by the fact that so few other people view them the way I did (or just don't think it's important).

  content: I am going to try and defend this movie, only because I love it so much.
    I find the sexism repulsive, and yet, I think that the movie is mainly attacking
    intolerence. George, Tracey, and Connor are all intolerant in their own ways,
    and only Tracey and Connor come to realize it by the end. Although I have to fast-forward
    through the repugnant speech by Tracey's father, I take some comfort in the fact
    that the movie paints everyone - born rich, climbing the social ladder, and disgusted
    by the upper class - all as being equally guilty of intolerance.

  content: "Thanks so much for pointing this out. I agree with Amy in that I found
    the film very complex. It even reminded me of a Shakespearean comedy: the horrible/ostensibly
    loving father, the love interest who treats the woman badly but gets her in the
    end, and the woman being blamed for so much. I suppose its the formula for many
    a novel, play, and movie. \r\n\r\nAfter watching The Philadelphia Story for the
    first time, I thought, \"How depressing! I'm so glad times have changed.\" Then
    I read recently written reviews that described it as a delightful comedy about
    a frigid woman who eventually recants her mistakes and gets the right man back.
    What?! I also realized that so many modern romantic comedies are not as blatantly
    sexist, but are still about putting a powerful woman in her place. \r\n\r\nI found
    Connor, jerk that he could be (he seemed the lesser evil), and Tracy's tryst extraordinarily
    romantic. Also, Virginia Weidler was adorable."

    the movie theater said that this film was "odd" if you paid attention, but just
    "funny" if you didn't. I definitely appreciated that!

    It does a better job than I ever could of saying why I don't like this movie.
    And I'm so thrilled to know I'm not alone in my feelings!

    seen 'The Philadelphia Story'.  It was on BBC2 this afternoon but I was so completely
    appalled at the attitudes towards the Katherine Hepburn character I had to stop
    watching it.  A Google search on the sexual politics of the film brought up this
    site and I am rather relieved to find my own feelings shared.  \r\n\r\nShe was
    bonding very nicely with the James Stewart character so I am sorry to find she
    ended up with the obnoxious Cary Grant character at the end.  The whole thing
    was completely depressing.\r\n\r\n(I like your Buffy posts!  I was a huge Buffy
    fan in the late 90s but the terrible Season 7 rather spoiled things.)"

    Thanks Victoria for agreeing with me! It makes me so cross that people like this film so uncritically because it rubs me up the wrong way that they can't see the sexism. It also makes me like Katharine Hepburn a little less because she wanted to make it so much that she brought the rights (via Howard Hughes).

    And thanks for liking my Buffy posts...

<p>It&rsquo;s been several years since I sat down and watched the classic film <em>The Philadelphia Story </em>which is routinely considered one of the best American films ever made and one of the best romantic comedies ever made. It was broadcast as a tribute to Katharine Hepburn who would have been one hundred on the 12th May so I thought I would sit down and see if this film was really as anti-women as I remembered.</p>
<p><strong>And it is.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, I am a big fan of films from the thirties and forties and among my favourite actors are Myrna Loy, Claudette Colbert, Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, Jean Arthur, Barbara Stanwyck and Ingrid Bergman and secondly, I know "The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there" but if this film was as racist as it is sexist then what would the consensus be? Appreciations for <em>Birth of a Nation</em> and <em>Gone With the Wind</em> are always prefaced with apologies for their racist content so where are they for this?</p>
<p>The key moments in the film&rsquo;s sexism include:
<ul>
<li>the opening scene when Dexter thinks better of punching Tracy but simply shoves her roughly to the ground</li>
<li>the quite stomach clenching scene when Tracy&rsquo;s father explains why a man philanders which is a combination of a fear of growing older and of not having a loving daughter to give the illusion of youth. &ldquo;A devoted young girl gives a man the illusion that youth is still his&hellip;because, without her, he might be inclined to go in search of his youth. That's just as important to him as it is to any woman. But with a girl of his own, full of warmth for him, full of foolish, unquestioning, uncritical affection&rdquo; Naturally, if this view was challenged or refuted then it wouldn&rsquo;t be so hideous but it isn&rsquo;t and by the end Tracy reconciles without further reference to his words.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Because you'll never be a first-class human being or a first-class woman until you've learned to have regard for human frailty.&rdquo; Did you know that being a human and a woman are mutually exclusive?</li>
<li>Dexter blaming Tracy for his drink problem or at least for making it worse because she was frigid (and that apparently is her problem: her frigidity both emotionally and sexually) &ldquo;When I discovered that my relationship to her was supposed to be not that of a loving husband and a good companion but&hellip;that of a kind of high priest to a virgin goddess. Then my drinks grew deeper and more frequent.&rdquo; Once again, Tracy is the one with problems, problems spelled out in humiliating ways while the men&rsquo;s problems do exist but aren&rsquo;t addressed at all. And, the undercurrent here is that having sex is the equivalent of love and companionship.</li>
<li>finally, Tracy decides to re-marry Dexter who she has shown no sign of being attracted to: what a lovely happy ending, re-marry the man whose final words to you at the end of your marriage were spoken in the form of violence.</li></ul></p>
<p>There is a rather better written review from <a href="http://www.eclectica.org/v11n1/hubschman_salon.html">Eclectica </a>magazine by Thomas J. Hubschman which echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition, the views on class are rather interesting too with the working class character portrayed as a narrow-minded oaf.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image523" src="/images/uploads/2007/05/virginia-weidler.jpg" alt="Virginia Weidler in the Philadelphia Story" /></div>I must mention the truly wonderful performance by Virginia Weidler whose dancing and singing are timelessly funny. She is on a sad list of child actors who died young: Peggy Ann Garner, Natalie Wood, Judy Garland, Brandon de Wilde, Bobby Driscoll, etc.</code></p>
