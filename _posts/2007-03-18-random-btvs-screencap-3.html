<div style="text-align:center;"><img id="image404" src="/images/uploads/2007/03/s-mother.jpg" alt="Amy's mother in Buffy's The Witch" /></div><br clear="all"/>We have debated who that girl in the opening credits in season 1 and 2 was and it turns out to be Amy's mother, Catherine. So not a girl and not really a random screencap.</p>
