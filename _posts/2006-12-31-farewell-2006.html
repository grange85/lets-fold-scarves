    Re: Farewell 2006, item2
    Firefly and Serenity - a Western in space is no way to sell a tv series but that&rsquo;s what it is

          They originally pitched star Trek as a sort of &ldquo;&lsquo;Wagon Train&rsquo; to the stars&rdquo; as I recall
          Firefly &#38; movie put me in mind of the Old West Reconstruction Period (1866-1877).
          Delightful cast and YES who would no adore River?

<p>It's been a good year.
<pr>Adam continues to be as lovable, funny, smart, sweet and gentle as ever and his achievement in passing his grade 2 piano exam with merit makes me especially proud.
<pr>Andy and I have now been together for sixteen years since the Villiers House Christmas party...and, in a number of ways,  I don't think our relationship has been stronger.
<pr>I like my work and I'm well paid for what I do. It's not always inspirational but there aren't many jobs like that that I am qualified to do (or can be bothered to do; effort and ambition not being my strong points). I have completed my sixth year of studying at the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open</a> <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/">University</a> and I could accept a degree if I wanted (BA/BSc Open degree). However, I think I would like to get a named degree but finding a course I want to do and finding time to do it in is getting harder.
<pr>Here are some reasons that I have less inclination to study:
<pr>
<ol>
<li><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> - although we finished season seven in January, the rest of the year has been taken up with rewatching it (and in the case of some episodes, rewatching and rewatching)</li>
<li><em>Firefly</em> and <em>Serenity</em> - a Western in space is no way to sell a tv series but that's what it is and it works very well indeed - the ensemble cast is perfect but I have a soft spot for Summer Glau who played River with serious mischievousness</li>
<li>message boards</li>
<li>blogs</li>
<li>fan fiction - if I had been asked a year and a half ago what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction">fan fiction</a> was I would have had no idea and when told I would have snorted and sniggered with derision - however, I have surprised myself spending a <em>lot</em> of time reading the stuff - I admit that a great deal of it is poor (most of it isn't even edited for spelling and punctuation) - and far too much of it has far too much sex (considering its early 70s roots as romantic fiction that isn't surprising) but some of it is stunning; <a href="http://www.cryptoffic.com/author/p-t/tulipp/tulipp_bread.html"><em>Bread</em></a> by Tulipp is one of the best things I have ever read. And it doesn't hurt to mention it again but Jet Wolf's <a href="http://www.btvschosen.com/"><em>The Chosen</em></a> which is a continuation of <em>BtVS</em> is an amazing body of sustained writing which is as funny and moving as the "real" thing. Jet Wolf loves <a href="http://jetwolf.livejournal.com/218998.html">Tara</a> and <a href="http://www.btvschosen.com/s8/813_promo.php">brought her back </a>and that leads to...</li>
<li>Amber Benson - "In the end, I discovered that being the nice guy - when it's really just a front for being a coward - eventually leads to you becoming the Spawn of Satan. It's best just to be honest and forthright from the beginning - even if it means people call you names behind your back and don't like you as much. Just ignore them. I do." - I wish I was ever as insightful as that (and I am a coward).</li>
<li>comics - or graphic novels to make it sound grander</li>
<li>our ever expanding DVD collection - best films this year seen on DVD include <em>Adaptation</em>, <em>Fight Club</em>, <em>Heathers</em>, <em>Twelve Monkeys</em>, <em>Doctor X</em>, <em>Serenity</em>, and <em>Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</em></li>
<li>television - <em>Ugly Betty</em>, <em>Life on Mars</em> and <em>University Challenge</em></li>
<li> music - Audrey, Espers and Aimee Mann</li>
<li>books - I do have time to read them, most of them unmemorable except <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em>, <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em>, <em>The Night Watch</em>, <em>Case Histories</em>, and <em>A Darkling Plain</em></p>
