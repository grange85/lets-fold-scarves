<p><strong><em>Angel</em> - "Slouching Towards Bethlehem"</strong> (Jeffrey Bell)</p>
<p>Cordelia and Charisma are back. And on form in both cases. I really miss the CCs which is odd since I never missed her from <em>Buffy</em>.</p>
<p>This was my favourite episode so far. The story zipped along and the message that telling the truth is more often than not the best policy is one that everyone in the Buffyverse should remember. The demon with the mouth was jolly creepy and I liked Cordy's hair.<br />

Dialogue about sidekicks is not helping. I feel towards Gunn as I do towards Topher because I&rsquo;m not totally convinced it's just the lines I don&rsquo;t like. I&rsquo;m suddenly struck (after several seasons!) by how good Nicholas Brendon is at delivering one-liners even when they aren&rsquo;t that great.</p>
