<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">I read <a href="http://theantiroom.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/what-the-boys-said-gender-imbalance-in-music-magazines/">an excellent post</a> about gender and music magazines over at the quite frankly superb collective blog, <a href="http://theantiroom.wordpress.com/">the Anti-Room</a> and a few music related thoughts came to mind.<br><br />
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";"><br></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">If the readership of music magazines is mainly men why is this readership apparently not interested in music by women? </span></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">&nbsp;</span></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">I complained to Word magazine several years ago about the lack of women on their front covers and their reply was that when they had put a woman on the cover (they didn&rsquo;t say who it was) their sales were lower. I wasn&rsquo;t really impressed with that as an answer. On a side note, if there isn&rsquo;t a woman on the cover (she doesn&rsquo;t even need to be the featured artist, just a mention will do), I won&rsquo;t buy the magazine. I bet I have really dented their sales.</span></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">&nbsp;</span></p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Trebuchet MS";">One other thing I have observed is that when a chance to feature a woman arrives, it is not taken. When Kate Bush released Aerial in 2005 (by any standards a major event), only Mojo put her on the cover.&nbsp; <span><br></span></span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;">Last Wednesday, while making bread I listened to an hour of Huey Morgan on 6 Music and he played no female artists, today he got to the 45 minute mark until he managed to play the Staple Singers. Goodness knows, I&#39;m not asking for silly things like gender parity but no women worth playing?<br></p>
