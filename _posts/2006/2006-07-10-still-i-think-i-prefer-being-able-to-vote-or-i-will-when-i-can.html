<p><strong>Halloween</strong> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255296/">Carl Ellsworth </a>- apparently he was <a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/carl-ellsworth/">fired</a> which is a shame because I liked this episode a lot)</p>
<p>A fantastic standalone episode. Unusually, the low point was SMG as an unconvincing 18th century damsel in distress &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t believe in her. There was a fine smirking performance by <a href="http://robinsachs.com/main.html">Robin Sachs</a> as Ethan Rayne and hello <a href="http://www.larrybagby.com/bio.html">Larry</a>!</p>
<p>Xander lived off &ldquo;army man&rdquo; for a fair few episodes and Cordelia as ever is very funny (I really never appreciated her first time around).</p>
<p>Willow may have stunned many in her skimpy costume but to me she looked too skinny &ndash; she was much sexier as Vamp Willow but it is always a pleasure to watch an episode in which Willow takes charge.</p>
<p>Two classic lines: &ldquo;she couldn't've dressed up like <a href="http://www.geocities.com/xenitebrach/xena_chakram.jpg">Xena</a>?&rdquo; and &ldquo;who died and made her the boss?&rdquo; (the latter is one of those clever lines that make you buff your imaginary fingernails because <em>you </em>got the joke).</p>
<p>"the ghost of what, exactly?"<br />
<img id="image117" src="/images/uploads/2006/07/Willow%20ghost.thumbnail.jpg" alt="The ghost of what?" /></p>
<p>Willow uses the word spaz (not for the first and certainly not the last time): &ldquo;Oh, I don't get wild. Wild on me equals spaz&rdquo; and this was, unsurprisingly, cut for the BBC broadcast. I have long been intrigued as to why this word isn&rsquo;t considered offensive in the USA and so just for my reading public (that's you, Andy) I found <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003020.html">this</a> interesting article.</p>
