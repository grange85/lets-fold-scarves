<p><strong>Hush (Joss Whedon)</strong></p>
<p>The Gentlemen give us twenty minutes without dialogue but many things become evident without the need for words to be exchanged.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/2006/04/thumb_buffy410_571.thumbnail.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Who Are You? (Joss Whedon)</strong></p>
<p>A tour de force from Sarah Michelle Gellar and a series of scenes that are perfect gems: Tara tells Willow that she is hers, Baith teases Spike with promises of leg buckling sex (except "it's wrong"), Baith teases Tara (&ldquo;so Willow's not driving stick anymore&rdquo;), Baith sleeps with Riley (and he doesn&rsquo;t notice), Tara and Willow do a spell, Fuffy talks to Giles (&ldquo;what's a <a href="http://www.legionmagazine.com/features/warart/img/02-05warart1.jpg">stevedore</a>?&rdquo;), and finally, Faith is very angry but who with?</p>

<p><strong>New Moon Rising (Marti Noxon)</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;this would be a sneaky cat&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I'm overhelping, aren't I?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;pretty much now&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I talked to Xander and he said you didn't have a new guy&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;are you freaked?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;do what makes you...h-h-happy&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;are you two involved?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;but now is not that time, I guess&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;it's extra flamey&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Yoko Factor (Doug Petrie)</strong></p>
<p>Spike divides the Scoobies and Giles gets drunk: &ldquo;bloody hell&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Restless (Joss Whedon)</strong></p>
<p>I could do without the cheese but dreams can be like this. Beautiful photography and score.</p>
