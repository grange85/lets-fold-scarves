<p>I loved Thelma and Louise and The Long Kiss Goodnight (and The Accidental Tourist) but I like Geena Davis more.</p>
<p>As I wrote <a href="http://www.moley75.co.uk/letsfoldscarves/?p=78">here</a> she has despaired of the lack of female role models in films and here are a <a href="http://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/response-from-geena-davis.html#c115050381945525965">few more of her insightful words</a>.</p>
<p>If my son was a girl I would imagine that years of <strong>Thomas</strong> the Tank Engine, <strong>Bob</strong> the Builder, Postman <strong>Pat</strong>, Fireman <strong>Sam,</strong> et al, would have made me even more sensitive (i.e. bloody angry) about this sort of thing than I already am.</p>
