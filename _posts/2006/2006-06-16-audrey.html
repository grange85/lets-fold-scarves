<p><em>Visible Forms</em> by <strong><a href="http://heylisa.net/audrey/index.php">Audrey</a></strong> (not a woman but four women: from Sweden) is out in the UK on 31st July but don&rsquo;t wait that long. Buy it from <a href="http://www.tenderversion.com/shop_music.php">tenderversion </a>for &euro;14 (just over &pound;9.50) including p&p and you can&rsquo;t be disappointed if you like Tara Jane O&rsquo;Neil, Rachel&rsquo;s, Ida, Low (particularly with Mimi singing) and fantastic music. It&rsquo;s moving, layered and intelligent music with wonderful strings, brass and piano arrangements. Some songs like <em>Plain Pieces</em> and <em>Traverse</em> stop me cold, making me hold my breath and my stomach tumble.</p>
