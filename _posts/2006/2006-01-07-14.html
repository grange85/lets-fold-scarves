    yeah i know what you mean about soundtrack of the year!
    that was the only cd playing in my car for 9 months.
    then i decided to get the other 2 buffy ones and the angel one as well.

    Yup! My car is Buffyverse friendly.

    p.s. - thank you for the words of support.

<p>Apparently it is the time of year that you recall the best music you bought (and/or heard) last year.<br />
My list is headed by the very belated discovery (belated in the sense that she has been around for years) of Paula Frazer who I heard on Tom Robinson's show on 6Music. She sang a couple of songs and her beautiful soaring voice took me by surprise. What astonished me most is that I hadn't heard of her before - her style is exactly what I like - spine tingling vocals, folky and country style arrangements - sort of a less arch kd lang.</p>
<p>Paula Frazer - Leave the Sad Things Behind<br />
Kathleen Edwards - Back to Me<br />
Maria Taylor - 11:11<br />
Aimee Mann - Forgotten Arm<br />
Kate Bush - Aerial</p>
<p>All these albums were out this year.</p>
<p>My discoveries of the year include Paula Frazer, of course, Tara Jane O'Neil, Azure Ray,and Sarah Harmer. This was also the year I decided that downloading Barbara Manning songs should be replaced by actually buying her albums to keep her going in college so I bought 1212 which is brilliant.</p>
<p>My guilty pleasure of the year is the soundtrack to Once More With Feeling.</p>
