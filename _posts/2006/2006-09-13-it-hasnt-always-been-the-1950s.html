    Interesting discussion. I think here in the US we are a lot farther down the road of the kind of childhood those Telegraph letter signers were decrying. I am clearly in the camp that food choices and education are worse these days than they were in my days (although my mother was a horrible cook, so my personal food choices were always bad - either crap fast food or crap home cooked food), but I think the computer and the accompanying technological advances are almost entirely beneficial.

    I would also add that the food and education issues are also tied together with the lives that we as parents are living. When you are at work for such a large percentage of time, it is certainly harder to plan and prepare healthy meals, or spend the time to help your child better understand what they learned at school.
