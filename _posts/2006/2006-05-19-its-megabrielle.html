<p>Whenever I have a colon vs semi-colon moment I google <em>colon semi xena</em> to find <a href="http://www.gabwhacker.com/xwp/bluequill/">The Blue Quill</a> which uses the Xena and Gabrielle characters in suggestive situations to illustrate good grammar. I always thought it was a clever and fun way of presenting the subject and that was before I discovered fan fiction (which now puts it into context: I was so naive...).</p>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.gabwhacker.com/xwp/bluequill/ellipses.asp">ellipses</a>...</p>
