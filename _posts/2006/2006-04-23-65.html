<p><strong>The Pack</strong> (<a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/matt-kiene/">Matt Kiene</a> and <a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/joe-reinkemeyer/">Joe Reinkemeyer</a>)</p>
<p>Willow being athletic was a pleasant surprise, I'm sure she never appears in a gym again. <a href="http://www.nickbrendon.com/">Nicholas Brendon</a> was so good at being a bad boy that they really should have got him to do it more often: when he's mean to "pasty face" Willow, the effect is quite disturbing. We learn a lot about Willow in this episode, she, for one thing, is not afraid to tackle Xander about his behaviour but at the same time she is insecure enough to think his behaviour is something to do with her weakness. She is too clever to fall for his charm when he is locked up though stupid enough to fall for the zookeeper&rsquo;s line. On a much more trivial front, she didn't suit her hair pulled back and she should definitely get it cut, I quite like the colour though. <a href="http://www.lack-of-surprise.com/bailey/">Eion Bailey</a> was notable as one of the pack, the generic "high school" boys often past me by in BtVS but he was eye-catching then as he is now: he is ought to be a star by now. A couple of other things, Giles was far too easily beaten by the Braveheart reject; I think he should train harder with Buffy to get into Ripper shape. Poor Principal Flutie! And the poor wee piglet.</p>
<p>"It was like the <a href="http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/howtodo.html">Heimlich</a>, with stripes!"</p>
<p>"You remember, you fail math, you flunk out of school, you end up being the guy at the pizza place that sweeps the floor and says, 'Hey, kids, where's the cool parties this weekend?' We've been through this" (definite foreshadowing!)</p>
<p>"It's devastating. He's turned into a sixteen-year-old boy. Course, you'll have to kill him" "Giles, I'm serious" "So am I. Except for the part about killing him. Testosterone is a great equalizer. It turns all men into morons. He will, however, get over it" "I cannot believe that you, of all people, are trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceptic">Scully</a> me. There is something supernatural at work here. Get your books! Look stuff up!"</p>
<p>"Why couldn't Xander be possessed by a puppy or, or some ducks?" (years later in season four, Willow is still very upset by Xander's <a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/unpleasant-possession/">hyena possession</a>)</p>
<p>"No, but it's safe to say that in his animal state his idea of wooing doesn't involve a Yanni CD and a bottle of Chianti"</p>
