<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">I am looking forward to the new <a href="http://www.sarahharmer.com/">Sarah Harmer</a> album. My appreciation of her has crept on me very subtly. I had downloaded a handful of random tracks by her (I do that a lot; download tracks and subsequently haven't a clue why I downloaded them and by what </font><font size="-1">tortuous </font><font size="2" face="Tahoma">route I got there) including <em>Uniform Grey</em> and <em>Capsized</em> which I absently put on my mp3 player. They would turn up and I would wonder who it was I was listening to (my player doesn&rsquo;t necessarily stretch to showing you the artists&rsquo; names). Eventually it dawned on me that they were great songs sung in a beautiful rich voice and the lyrics started to seep in too. I downloaded more and realised (ahem) that parting with money was in order. Two particular favourites lyrically (and musically) are <em>Silver Road</em> and <em>Almost</em> (and I am sure that I am not in a minority with my second choice).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Here&rsquo;s a snippet of each: </font></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/sarahharmer.htm#a5"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Silver Road</font></a></em></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">I'll be way down a silver road, I'll go</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">where the moon has it lit up</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">turn off your headlights and go slowly</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">I don't want it to let up.</font></p>
<p><em><font size="2" face="Tahoma">(in Britain, turning your lights off wouldn&rsquo;t have the same effect as in Canada, what with all the light pollution but it&rsquo;s lovely imagery)</font></em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/sarahharmer.htm#a2"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Almost</font></a></em></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">And if I am a sailor, </font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">then you are the warm gulf wind, </font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">and you've blown into this little port </font><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">and roused my dreams again.</font></p>
<p><em><font size="2" face="Tahoma">(hmm, warm Gulf wind, I feel toasty and loved)</font></em></p>
