<p><strong>Teacher's Pet</strong> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339264/">David Greenwalt</a>)</p>
<p>Episode 4 has a very poor, cliched plot and it's a bit worrying that, so early on, a plot can be this dull and implausible (I mean implausible in the non-demon way obviously, things like Gregory's glasses remaining in his classroom and Blayne still being alive when Xander turns up) with a (it turns out) <em>non sequitur</em> ending. How is it going to last?</p>
<p>But as usual, some cracking dialogue:</p>
<p>"God, every day here is the same" "Bright, sunny, beautiful, how ever can we escape this torment?"</p>
<p>"She never said anything about him being buff!"</p>
<p>"it's the most beautiful chest...dress I've ever seen"</p>
<p>"Virgins? Well, Xander's not a, uh...I mean, he's probably..." "...gonna die!"</p>
<p>OK, not that great but next!</p>
