<p>Since there is a gibbous moon, here are the lyrics to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_World">Ghost World </a>by the marvellous <a href="http://www.aimeemann.com/home.html">Aimee Mann</a>:</p>
<p>Finals blew, I barely knew<br />
My graduation speech<br />
And with college out of reach<br />
If I don't find a job<br />
It's down to Dad and Myrtle Beach</p>
<p>So I'm bailing this town<br />
Or tearing it down<br />
Or probably more like hanging around<br />
Hanging around</p>
<p>Everyone I know is acting weird<br />
Or way too cool<br />
They hang out by the pool<br />
So I just read a lot and rode my bike<br />
Around the school</p>
<p>'Cause I'm bailing this town<br />
Or tearing it down<br />
Or probably more like hanging around<br />
Hanging around</p>
<p>And all that I need now is someone<br />
with the brains and the know-how<br />
to tell me what I want...anyhow</p>
<p>12th of June, a <a href="http://home.gwi.net/~aljordan/astro/moonTak.html">gibbous Moon</a><br />
Was this the longest day?<br />
I'll walk down to the bay<br />
and jump off of the dock and watch<br />
the summer waste away</p>
<p>Then I'm bailing this town<br />
Or tearing it down<br />
Or probably more like hanging around<br />
Then I'm bailing this town<br />
Or tearing it down<br />
Or probably more like hanging around</p>
<p>Hanging around<br />
Hanging around<br />
Hanging around<br />
So tell me what I want</p>
