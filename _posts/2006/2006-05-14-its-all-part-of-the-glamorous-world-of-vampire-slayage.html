<p><strong>Out of Mind, Out of Sight </strong>(story by Joss Whedon, written by Ashley Gable & Thomas A. Swyden)</p>
<p>I love the premise of this episode: that someone is so invisible to her classmates that she literally becomes invisible. As an occasional invisible girl myself, I would have preferred her not to become quite so insane and murderous but as it <em>is</em> written it's chilling. Unfortunately, the ending is atrocious and casts a pall over the episode: government involvement has no place in BtVS (<a href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/episodes/season-4/407/">oops</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://cleaduvall.net/">Clea DuVall</a> was excellent as Marcie but rather miscast because she is one <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39054226@N00/15957489/">striking woman</a>. By the way, Marcie was not &ldquo;unpopular&rdquo;, unpopular children are actively disliked whereas no one even saw Marcie to care.</p>
<p>Cordelia developed (at last) from being a funny bitch (&ldquo;I don't recall ever seeing you here before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no, I have a life.&rdquo;) to become a bitch with a hidden heart: &ldquo;You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willow was wearing a Scooby Doo t-shirt! <img id="image84" src="/images/uploads/2006/05/scooby%20t-shirt.thumbnail.jpg" alt="First Scooby "mention"" /> It's a pity her hair's in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't even <em>like</em> chocolates. Okay, that was the lamest comeback of our times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vampire in love with a Slayer! It's rather poetic in a maudlin sort of way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God! 'Have a nice summer. Have a nice summer.' This girl had no friends at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. 'Have a <em>great </em>summer.' See, I cared!&rdquo; (Willow&rsquo;s response here is so in character)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight!&rdquo; &ldquo;Can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?&rdquo; &ldquo;If I'm not crowned tonight then, then Marcie's won! And that would be bad. She's evil, okay? Way eviler than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see. I think we should start with your smile. I think it should be wider.&rdquo;</p>
