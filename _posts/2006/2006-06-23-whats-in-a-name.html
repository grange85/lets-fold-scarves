<p>Quite a lot really, so why <a href="http://www.heylisa.net/audrey/">Audrey</a>?</p>
<p>There are several possibilities: number one is a love of Audrey <a href="http://www.audrey1.com/">Hepburn</a>, or since they are young things, Audrey <a href="http://audrey.amelie.free.fr/">Tautou</a>. Maybe they have been watching too much British TV and have a thing for Audrey from <a href="http://www.corrie.net/profiles/characters/roberts_audrey.html">Corrie</a> or more understandably Audrey <a href="http://www.sitcom.co.uk/manor_born/characters.shtml">fforbes-Hamilton</a>. Or maybe, Audrey <a href="http://www.audreyflack.com/AF/paint.html">Flack</a> (I cheated/googled on that one) but looking at her work, perhaps not. Or Audrey <a href="http://www.audreyniffenegger.com/">Niffenegger </a>but I hope not because I thought The Time Traveller&rsquo;s Wife was dreadful.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, someone Swedish, or maybe it was just a name they liked.</p>
