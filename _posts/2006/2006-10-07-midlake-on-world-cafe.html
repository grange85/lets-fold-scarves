<p>One of my favourite albums from this year is <em>The Trials of Van Occupanther</em> by Midlake. I have recently discovered the joy of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/topics/topic.php?topicId=1039">NPR music</a> and, in particular, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=39&agg=1">World Caf&eacute;</a>. Midlake were <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6111029">in performance</a> early in September and they did three wonderful live versions of <em>Roscoe</em>, <em>Van Occupanther</em> and <em>Head Home</em>. I hadn&rsquo;t realised the album was a concept album (I was still in the &ldquo;oh what a lovely sound&rdquo; stage and hadn&rsquo;t read the lyrics) but luckily they don&rsquo;t produce a folk-rock <em>Tommy</em> but is more like Aimee Mann&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://popmatters.com/music/reviews/m/mannaimee-forgotten.shtml">The Forgotten Arm</a></em>.</p>
