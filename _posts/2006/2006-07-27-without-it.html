<p>I love the Internet which I suppose is as inane as saying I love books but plenty of people do say they hate or distrust the Internet so snap.</p>
<p>Anyway, two things I have discovered lately which I owe to the &lsquo;net. One is that the stretch marks I have on my <a href="http://shapeofamother.blogspot.com/">stomach</a> were the result of simply being pregnant <em>and</em> normal and <em>not </em>the result of being inadequate, fat and old. Secondly, the film &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wherediditallgoright.com/BLOG/2006/07/triple-bill.html">diary</a>&rdquo; I kept when I was teenager was not unusual or strange or sad or silly but something people who love films and in particular, the films bought by Leslie Halliwell for Channel 4 did.</p>
