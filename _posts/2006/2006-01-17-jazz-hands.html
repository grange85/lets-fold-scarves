<p>Once More With Feeling is one of  the finest moments of television ever.</p>
<p>Which hasn&rsquo;t got too much to do with the following story except that I was puzzled by the gesture that Tara makes in &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got a Theory&rdquo;. The <a href="http://www.buffyworld.com/buffy/season6/transcripts/107_tran.shtml">transcript on Buffyworld</a> (how I love those transcripts) says that she is doing "jazz hands". I haven&rsquo;t a clue what jazz hands are so I googled them. I found a blog where <a href="http://www.planetdan.net/blog/2005/09/googling-jazz-hands.htm">Planetdan</a> discusses his search for jazz hands and goes on to chat about Rita. He never says why he&rsquo;s googling jazz hands even though he is asked. Later I find that the author of <a href="http://www.killfee.net/2005/10/17/weird-things-i-google/">Kill Fee </a>has also searched for jazz hands and also found Planetdan's blog which gives her a "warm feeling of harmonic convergence". Well, me too.</p>
