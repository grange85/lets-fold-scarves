  content: "[...] Ty King wrote two episodes of BtVS, this and Some Assembly Required.
    At first thought, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any connection between them,
    particularly in terms of quality but as I wrote the best thing about SAR was Jenny
    and Giles&rsquo; relationship and this has excellent interactions between the
    two. I have a lot of sympathy for Jenny &ndash; her loyalties must lie with her
    family and her betrayal of Buffy and Giles had to happen because of that. [...]"

<p><strong>Some Assembly Required </strong>(<a href="http://whedonesque.com/comments/4619">Ty King</a>)</p>
<p>A terrible story that was utterly derivative and I didn&rsquo;t care about any of the secondary characters. The only redemption was the nascent relationship between Rupert and Jenny. I have turned into a middle-aged woman: I adore <a href="http://www.anthonyhead.org/">Anthony Head</a>. He has been a delight as Giles: not only does he deliver his lines beautifully but he is also the master of the look and the gesture. The sequence with Giles not asking Jenny out was lovely: Jenny saying that Ms Calendar was her father&rsquo;s name (what was that about?), Giles pathetic attempts at asking Jenny out, Jenny deftly asking him out to the game and his &ldquo;that went well&rdquo; were just wonderful. <a href="http://www.robialamorte.com/main.html">Robia LaMorte </a>(what a name) is one good-looking woman; at the end when she is suggesting another date with Giles, she looks spectacular.<br />

<p>Another Willow gay moment: the photographer says (of another girl) &ldquo;look at those legs&rdquo; and Willow replies &ldquo;no, thanks&rdquo; (protesting too much?).</p>
<p>Fun dialogue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I'm an old-fashioned gal. I was raised to believe that men dig up the corpses and the women have the babies&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danced with is a pretty loose term. Mated with might be a little closer&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple deduction. Ms. Calendar is reasonably dollsome, especially for someone in your age bracket. She already knows that you're a school librarian, so you don't have to worry about how to break that embarrassing news to her&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in here but back issues of Scientific American. Ooo, I haven't read this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just think it's rather odd that a nation that prides itself on its virility should feel compelled to strap on forty pounds of protective gear just in order to play rugby&rdquo;</p>
