<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">OK, not ruined but it is certainly my current obsession.</font><font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<font face="Times New Roman"><br />
<font size="2" face="Tahoma">It was kept under control while Andy and were working our way through the box sets (if under control equals watching two episodes a night) but after watching Sunnydale being swallowed up I was on the internet catching up and trying to find out whether the consensus was that BtVS had essentially gone downhill after Tabula Rasa when magic became a metaphor for addiction (it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a power not an indulgence) and we had to watch Buffy and Spike boffing. I think the answer is yes, and, don&rsquo;t get me started (not just now anyway) on what they did to Willow in Season seven.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">There is so much! I am currently reading my way through <a href="http://www.btvschosen.com/s8/ep_free.php">The Chosen</a> (I have linked to the description free episode list because the pictures on the home page contain a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_%28media%29">spoiler</a>) which is a continuation of the series (I think there are others) and it is remarkable. I have just finished episode 03 of Season 9 and so far, the storylines, the dialogue, the humour, the drama and the guest appearances are spot on. It&rsquo;s not perfect</font> <font size="2" face="Tahoma">but then when was the &ldquo;real&rdquo; BtVS perfect (not after Tabula Rasa anyway!)?</font> </font></font></p>
