  content: Funny because I adored "Run to Ruin" - but think "On Leaving" is closer
    to the first two albums than that one. I do love them all though - and "dull"?
    I don't think so!

<p>I'm just <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2006/10/05/album-of-the-year-contenders-4-5-6-and-7/">copying Andy</a> with this post.</p>

<p>Audrey - <em>Visible Forms</em> - I have raved before so suffice to say it's <em>all</em> brilliant</p>
<p><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000F3ALAG.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V52387955_.jpg" alt="TVO"></p>
<p>Midlake - <em>The Trials of Van Occupanther</em> - comparisons to The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev haven't dampened my enthusiasm</p>
<p><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000FQITT8.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V64064394_.jpg" alt="EII"></p>
<p>Espers - <em>Espers II</em> - stand out: <em>Mansfield And Cyclops</em></p>

<p>Tara Jane O'Neil - <em>In Circles</em> - tjo's voice is oddly sexy - check <a href="http://www.toolshed-media.com/ts/tara-jane-oneil-blue-room.mp3">this</a> out</p>
<p>My albums of the year seem to equal the albums I have bought this year (except Nina Nastasia's <em>On Leaving</em> - Andy is a big fan and really likes this new album but I feel it's a bit <strike>dull</strike> lacklustre and, rather like PJ Harvey's, I think her first two albums (<em><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1947500">Dogs</a></em> and <em>The Blackened Air</em>) are head and shoulders better than the subsequent ones).</p>
