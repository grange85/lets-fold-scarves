  content: If you ever get the chance to see k.d. lang live, take it. I've seen her
    twice, and although she has that truly divine voice, she has the greatest earthy
    personality. I love her.

  content: I have seen kd live in Brighton. She was fabulous. I'm not sure she has
    toured much over here since then (it was a long time ago - well over ten years)
    and if she has it would have been at bigger venues which I'm not too keen on.

<p><img id="image227" src="/images/uploads/2006/11/ingenue.jpg" class="left" alt="Ingenue" />Andy sent me <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=1334030&blogID=196022321">this link</a> and for me it's Aimee Mann and k.d. lang (the woman has the voice of a goddess but I don't want to be inflicted with Madeleine Peyroux, Alison Moyet, and Norah Jones just because <a href="http://www.kdlang.com/discography/1992.htm"> Ingenue</a> is a work of genius).</p>
