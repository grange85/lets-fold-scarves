<p>I stumbledupon <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon </a> because the BBC News website was reviewing <a href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/websites/">Time's fifty something or another websites</a> and a reader's comment said you have to try SU: it is wonderful (and an awesome timewaster!).</p>
