<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256524/">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion </a></p>
<p>I took a while to warm to this but rather like Helen Hunt&rsquo;s character I thawed. I also thawed towards the actress too. At first I kept disbelievingly muttering "she's an Oscar winner you know" (as is Charlize Theron who actually looked a forties star) but eventually I shut up and enjoyed her performance (her pointy nose reminded me of Jodie Foster who is never a bad thing to be reminded of). The story was featherlike but charming, the supporting cast was top quality and I liked the few lines that acknowledged his age, nearsightedness and shortness (and baldness).</p>
