<p>Adam is always sighing "Buffy, Buffy, Buffy" because he thinks we're sad for being such fans so this is for him:</p>
<p><object  ><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/BNlFA1BM8lw"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/BNlFA1BM8lw" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"  ></embed></object></p>
<p>ETA: This video has been removed from YouTube because it is quite obvious that something clever like this was a threat to DVD sales or <em>whatever</em>. Stupid stupid attitude by TPTB.</p>
<p>ETA: Hooray! I have found <a href="http://www.babygorilla.com/warehouse/art/Video/buffy.mov">the original</a> at the originator's website. He is Chuck Jones (obviously not that one) whose other work can be found at <a href="http://www.babygorilla.com/warehouse/art/chuckart.html">babygorilla.com</a>. Thanks Chuck.</p>
