<p><strong>Never Kill a Boy on a First Date</strong> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0220754/">Rob Des Hotel</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0060678/">Dean Batali</a>)</p>
<p>This is an interesting episode in that Buffy actively rejects a boy who is turned on by danger despite his sensitive side but, once again, the plot and its execution is rather dull. But we do get the exciting possibilities offered by the Annoying One, er. There was a nice moment when Xander compares his childish watch <img id="image63" src="/images/uploads/2006/04/tweety.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Tweety" />with Owen's gold one <img id="image64" src="/images/uploads/2006/04/s%20watch.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Owen's" /> and lots of witty character interactions between Buffy, Xander & Willow, Buffy, Owen & Cordelia and Buffy & Giles.</p>
<p>Dialogue gold in abundance though:</p>
<p>"We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Buffy, and you're history!"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's great! I kill them, you fence their stuff"</p>
<p>"I have something like that. Well, it's an actual blanket. Uh, and I don't really carry it around anymore. So! Emily Dickens, huh? She's great!" "Dickinson" "She's good also"</p>
<p>"I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show" "Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm"</p>
<p>"Everyone forgets, Willow, that knowledge is the ultimate weapon"</p>
<p>"Hello, salty goodness!"</p>
<p>"Did you see that? He tried to bite me! What a sissy!"</p>
<p>"No, I had very definite plans about my future. I was going to be a fighter pilot. Or possibly a grocer"</p>
