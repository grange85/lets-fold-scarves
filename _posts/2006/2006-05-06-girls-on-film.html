<p><a href="http://feministing.com/archives/004982.htm">Where are they?</a></p>
<p>What I have long thought to be so regarding female roles has been shown to be true (in a study by Geena Davis's <a href="http://www.seejane.org/">SeeJane</a> organisation) that girls and women are under represented in children's films. Why is the Slinky Dog or the dinosaur or any of the minor characters except Bo-Beep in Toy Story a boy? Why is Princess Fiona the only significant female character in Shrek? Why is Spirited Away the only animated film I can think of from the 21st century with a female lead?</p>
<p>PS It took me ages to realise "a dope role model" was a compliment.</p>
