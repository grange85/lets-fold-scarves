<p><img id="image207" src="/images/uploads/2006/11/poppy.jpg" class="left" alt="Poppy" />Today is Remembrance Day, a day bound up with the <a href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/">Royal British Legion</a> and the <a href="http://www.poppy.org.uk/">Poppy Appeal</a>.</p>
<p>I don't want to wear a red poppy: the British Legion supports servicemen and not the civilians who gave their lives in munitions factories, shipyards, coal mines and their own homes and I want to remember them too.<br />
<br clear=left>The White Poppy seems to be a better alternative or just quiet inner reflection.<br />
