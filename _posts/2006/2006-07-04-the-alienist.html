<p><a href="http://www.17thstreet.net/">The Alienist </a>by <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/11897.html">Caleb Carr</a></p>
<p>I read this because another book, which is on my tbr pile, has been described as this meets Buffy. I don't usually find the whole "meets" thing very helpful but when I read the blurb for this, I thought it did sound promising.</p>
<p>I was surprised that it wasn't at all intellectual which for some reason I had expected it to be. In fact, it is a straightforward serial killer novel but set in the 1890s. However, it is the period detail that won me over to the book, I loved <a href="http://www.sarahwaters.com/">Sarah Waters</a>&rsquo; Victorian novels for several reasons but not least because I was utterly convinced by the setting and it is the same here.</p>
<p>The early forensic science, the first days of psychiatry, the appalling social conditions, nascent feminism - all added to the chilling atmosphere.</p>
<p>My only gripe was the slightly disappointing ending with too many "just in the nick of the time" moments. My only puzzle is just what we are supposed to make of the extra eyes in the apartment?</p>
