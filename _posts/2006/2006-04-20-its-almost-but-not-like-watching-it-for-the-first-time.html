<p>We are rewatching <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, obstentiously because we are going to start watching <em>Angel</em> when we get to the end of season three but really because at least one of is a fervent fan. Actually, no, I'm not: I keep thinking I am then I realise that I have never written fan fiction, never created fan art, I don't have BtVS wallpaper and screensavers and I have never written a poem for my favourite character. So, I think I'm okay: then I remember I'm 41 and if I was 21 I would be doing all those things (except the poetry, I have <em>never</em> written poetry).</p>
<p>I digress. I have decided to make some notes about each episode as we go through them. I am not pretending to be comprehensive or clever or insightful (there are much better sites out there like <a href="http://www.buffyguide.com/episodesplain.shtml">BuffyGuide</a> and <a href="http://www.superjer.com/buffy/reviews.php">MikeJer</a> for that sort of thing) but I'm writing about what caught my eye (and ear, this is the Whedon World after all).</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest</strong> (<a href="http://whedonwiki.com/index.php/Main/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>)</p>
<p>Brian Thompson as Luke and Mark Metcalf as The Master as the villains are excellent; both are a little camp particularly The Master who reminds me of Richard (insert <em>Rocky Horror</em> or <em>Crystal Maze</em> or <em>Ever After</em> as appropriate) O'Brien. Buffy's moves are cool; leaping over the school fence, doing a <a href="http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/publications/usa-gymnastics/1996/4/coaching-corner.html">roundoff</a> the balcony, cartwheeling onto the stage, etc. When her stunt double lands very heavily on the side of a sarcophagus I winced, I think even experts must hurt when that happens. She uses a pool cue and a cymbal to great effect. Willow wears dungarees which is foreshadowing if you ask me. I love Willow's sneaky revenge on mean Cordelia and her dimwitted friend Harmony: "deliver". Giles is quite fey the first time we see him, the delight on his face when he places 'Vampyr' in front of Buffy is priceless.</p>

<p>Notable dialogue: "Hi! I'm an enormous slut!" "Hello! Would you like a copy of 'The Watchtower'?"<br />
"Well, when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty, or at all."<br />
"God! What is your childhood trauma?"<br />
"Do I horn in on your private discussions? No. Why? Because you're boring."</p>
