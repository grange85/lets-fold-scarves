<p><strong>Lie to Me</strong> (Joss Whedon)</p>
<p>Many of my headlines are quotes about Angel, which is odd because I&rsquo;m not a big fan.</p>
<p>This is a serious episode about how we could deal in extreme circumstances with pain versus immortality but the best thing about it is the <a href="http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/divinyls.htm">Divinyls</a> conversation and Willow&rsquo;s face as she slowly catches on (I am shallow and easily pleased). Other notables: a lovely scene between Angel and Willow in her bedroom; I find it unlikely that Jenny would like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_truck">monster trucks</a> much less take Giles to a show; I liked the scenes between Ford and Spike; Buffy tells Angel she does love him; Ford thinks he has it all planned out and can justify his actions but his mind is as sick as his body; Buffy gets knocked out by a human, she&rsquo;s the bleeding Slayer, that shouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Dialogue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;and Marie Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_334.html">cake</a>!&rdquo; and with that Cordelia disappears from this episode</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's not in school, right? He looks older than her&rdquo; &ldquo;You're not wrong&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoa! Cold hands!&rdquo; &ldquo;You're not wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I'm gonna have to go with Dead Boy on this one&rdquo; &ldquo;Could you <em>not</em> call me that?&rdquo; &ndash; once again Xander is jealous of Angel</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Whating a what?&rdquo; &ndash; Buffy is a terrible dissembler which means she is very funny</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple more days and we'll get to do the two things every American teen should have the chance to do: die young, and stay pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren't two of those in the world&rdquo; &ndash; not until <a href="http://buffyology.com/img/eps/50.jpg">Doppelgangland</a> anyway</p>
<p>&ldquo;In no way do we stick out like <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/02/23/1935215.shtml">sore thumbs</a>&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay, but do they really stick out?&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sore thumbs. Do they stick out? I mean, have you ever seen a thumb and gone, Wow! That baby is sore!&rdquo; &ldquo;You have too many thoughts&rdquo; &ndash; each of them endearing</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't be ashamed! It's cool that you're open to it. We welcome anyone who's interested in the Lonely Ones.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lonely Ones?&rdquo; &ldquo;Vampires&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! We usually call them the nasty, pointy, bitey ones.&rdquo; &ldquo;So many people have that misconception but they who walk with the night are not interested in harming anyone. They are creatures above us. Exalted!&rdquo; &ldquo;You're a fool.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don't have to be so confrontational about it, other viewpoints than yours may be valid, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've known you for two minutes, and I can't stand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m almost complete with my quotes from this episode and I have only just remembered that this is a Joss episode which explains the sheer amount of good stuff.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you let everyone out, or your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.&rdquo; &ndash; once again Buffy fails to take out somebody who proves fatal to many more people in the future</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? &ldquo;We're stuck in a basement&rdquo; &ldquo;Buffy?&rdquo; &ldquo;She's <em>not </em>stuck in the basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean life?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah. Does it get easy?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Lie to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.&rdquo; &ndash; sob</p>
