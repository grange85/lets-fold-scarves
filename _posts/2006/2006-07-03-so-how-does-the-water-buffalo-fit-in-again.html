<p><strong>Reptile Boy </strong>(David Greenwalt)</p>
<p>What do <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/">Ghost World</a> and Reptile Boy have in <a href="http://bollygirl.tripod.com/definition.html#def">common</a>?</p>
<p>This is an episode with a lot of potential but rather like the not-so-good monster, it was all unconvincing. The implications of Buffy's single lie to Giles are summarized: "I told one lie, I had one drink" [a single drink that knocks out the Slayer] "Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words 'let that be a lesson' are a tad redundant at this juncture" [that's the Slayer's burden in a nutshell, make a single mistake and you endanger yourself, your friends and family, and the world!]. I&rsquo;m not persuaded by the course of Buffy and Angel&rsquo;s relationship through this episode. We are supposed to feel their great attraction but I don&rsquo;t really get them. Buffy&rsquo;s comment that she wants to die when they kiss is both tasteless and not clever. Xander&rsquo;s jealousy is funny (not in real life when you would want to hit him). And after Willow&rsquo;s rant, Buffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;sometime, I'll let you know&rdquo;, is just WTF?</p>
<p>The men have a hard time in this one: poor Giles gets humiliated by Buffy again when twice again and she wasn&rsquo;t even trying. Xander gets humiliated helping his friend (helping her because he was jealous but helping nevertheless).</p>
<p>Any average BtVS episode is essentially elevated to <em>better than any other TV show</em> by its dialogue and its delivery:</p>
<p>I love it when Willow lets rip and this is a snorter: &ldquo;Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off!  And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty! And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee? Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've gotta help Buffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She's sad because her lover gave her twelve gold coins, but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt, and now the dancing minions have nowhere to put their big maypole...fish thing&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh-huh. Why is she singing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Her lover? I thought that was her chiropractor&rdquo; &ldquo;Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because the paranormal is more normal and less...para of late is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, what a long day&rdquo; &ldquo;And you skipped three classes&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, and, of course, they flew by&rdquo; [I never skipped classes in school but I did in <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902387_en_1.htm">college</a> and, boy, did those hours drag, eating scones and drinking coffee in the canteen at Hilton]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not going with Angel. I'm going with, ye gods, Cordelia&rdquo; &ldquo;Cordelia?! Did I sound a little jealous just then, cause I'm not really...Cordelia?!&rdquo; &ldquo;Cordelia's much better for you than Angel&rdquo; [this is so not my imagination making these gay moments up]</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't want her. Look at her. She's all skin and bones. Half an hour later you'll be hungry&rdquo; [it&rsquo;s a close run thing between Buffy and Cordelia but essentially Buffy has a cheek]</p>
