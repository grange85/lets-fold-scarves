<p>There is a meme going around the <a href="http://selfstyledsiren.blogspot.com/2008/12/hardest-meme-ever.html">best</a> <a href="http://filmexperience.blogspot.com/2008/12/where-my-heart-lies-and-yours.html">film</a> blogs but since no-one is likely to tag me I'm just going to produce my own list of my twenty favourite actresses.</p>
<p>My first criterion is that the majority of the films made by the actresses are in English since I am not likely to have seen more than two or three of their films if they mainly star(red) in foreign language films. My second criterion follows from this and is that I must have seen more than four or more films with the actress in question. My third criterion is that I have to have watched any old nonsense in order to follow these actresses (examples of these in brackets)</p>
<p>In alphabetical order:</p>
<ul> Jean Arthur (<em>If You Could Only Cook</em>)<br />
Ingrid Bergman (<em>The Yellow Rolls-Royce</em>)<br />
Claudette Colbert (<em>Without Reservations</em>)<br />
Bette Davis (<em>The Watcher in the Woods</em>)<br />
Judy Davis (<em>Who Dares Wins</em>)<br />
Olivia de Havilland (<em>Airport '77</em>)<br />
Jodie Foster (<em>Nell</em>)<br />
Greta Garbo (<em>Anna Christie</em>)<br />
Judy Garland (<em>Love Finds Andy Hardy</em>)<br />
Miriam Hopkins (<em>The Chase</em>)<br />
Nicole Kidman (<em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>)<br />
Myrna Loy (<em>Airport 1975</em>)<br />
Julia Roberts (<em>Pretty Woman</em>)<br />
Barbara Stanwyck (<em>Stella Dallas</em>)<br />
Meryl Streep (<em>Mamma Mia!</em>)<br />
Emma Thompson (<em>Love Actually</em>)<br />
Sigourney Weaver (<em>Half Moon Stree</em>t)<br />
Kate Winslet (<em>Titanic</em>)<br />
<del>Reese Witherspoon (<em>Sweet Home Alabama</em>)</del><br />
Teresa Wright (<em>Somewhere in Time</em>)</ul></p>
<p>14th January 2014 edit! Out goes Reese Witherspoon and in comes Julianne Moore (<em>Evolution</em>)</p>
<p>I am going to tag <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/">Everything's Swirling</a>, <a href="http://www.laughingwild.blogspot.com/">Laughing Wild</a> and <a href="http://thistosay.blogspot.com/">this to say about that</a>.</p>
