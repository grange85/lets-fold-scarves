I don't really like Lifeboat. I don't like any of the characters or any of the actors playing them. I can feel sorry for them but a lot of the time they are rather annoying, or rude, or naïve, and it certainly feels a little weird that the German is portrayed as being cleverer than the allied characters. Hume Cronyn's accent is very aggravating – why couldn't he have just been Canadian!

I appreciate how ingenious the film making is and it never feels gimmicky but it doesn't work for me.
